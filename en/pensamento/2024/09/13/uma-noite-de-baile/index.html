Writing from the past - A ball night

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contoscotidianos/3099766">16/07/2011 - A ball night</a></p>

<p>- Stop being silly and come here, girl. - Ordered the mother in a mix of impatience with curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The daughter came out of the bathroom with small steps. Her long brown hair was held by a lilac band, but still flew loose with each step. Her white skin burned in a shy blush and her eyes looked at the floor.</p>

<p>When she raised her face and received the amazed look from her mother, she covered her face with her hands and let out a moan of someone about to burst into tears.</p>

<p>- Stop that, dear! You look beautiful. - The mother hugged her daughter and led her to a bench in front of a mirror.</p>

<p>That statement wasn’t unreal. The long lilac dress passed a few centimeters from the floor thanks to the high-heeled sandals, the black bodice tightened and accentuated her breasts, and a band squeezed her belly, closing in a luxurious and discreet bow on her back. Even lacking the makeup and final touches on her hair, the young woman (used to wearing jeans and t-shirts) already had a majestic and enchanting glow.</p>

<p>Her anxiety increased with every tick of the clock, her stomach hadn’t left her in peace for a long time, and her mother’s silly smile made everything worse. She must look ridiculous in that dress, but she liked it, which made her more nervous. It was a sign that she liked being ridiculous.</p>

<p>Foundation, mascara, eyeshadow, eyeliner, lipstick, and the picture kept getting more and more beautiful. The mirror seemed to frame a painting that was being worked on at that moment by a great artist. She wished her friends were there with her, it would be really cool to accompany this change in all of them, but she realized it would be even more fun to see the surprised faces when she walked through the doors of the ballroom.</p>

<p>- No mom, please! Leave my hair down! - She gestured in supplication. She looked very pretty, but she couldn’t afford to go out showing her ears, they were too ugly.</p>

<p>After a small discussion, the mother convinced her to at least arrange it in a more elaborate hairstyle. The anticipation made it seem like an eternity, but the result was glorious.</p>

<p>The lighter makeup brought light that, embraced by the hair color, highlighted the beauty of her thin and rounded face. Her beautiful eyes stood out from the harmonious ensemble with a youthful sparkle, as did the discreet smile that had come to her face and stayed.</p>

<p>The small discomfort, the fear, and the knot in her stomach returned when the mother clapped her hands and announced she was done. It was time to go down the stairs and be embarrassed by her father who, for sure, would be with the camera and would say something silly. But the worst would be having to put up with the pest of a younger brother who would mock her, even though she was fabulous.</p>

<p>On the way, she noticed that the stairs of the house were bigger than she imagined, they seemed to never end. Thousands of things went through her head. Giving up was the most recurring word, along with millions of flimsy excuses. Some were even good, but she was so nervous she didn’t even notice.</p>

<p>Upon arriving in the living room, the silence that followed was worse than any nonsense or joke. She needed to hear a sincere opinion and, more than that, she needed to hear that she was beautiful.</p>

<p>That was exactly what she heard, but it only made her blush like never before, increase her anxiety, and only manage to stay still because her legs didn’t respond (her wish was to run like never before, to where, she didn’t know).</p>

<p>The cause wasn’t the compliment, but the voice that made it. Her companion for that night was sitting in an armchair near her father, playing video games with her younger brother.</p>

<p>The young man stood up, buttoned his tuxedo, adjusted his bow tie, and approached to receive the girl. The mastery of the movement made him even more elegant and handsome, as if the light eyes, blond hair, and slender body weren’t enough.</p>

<p>Surely that would be a spectacular night.</p>
