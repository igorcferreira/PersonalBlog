Writing from the past - Breakfast

    <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2024 </span>

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contoscotidianos/3304201">29/10/2011 - Breakfast</a></p>

<p>He turned on the light out of habit for brightness. With dragging steps, he crossed the kitchen and opened the windows, letting the strong morning sun invade the space. He returned and let his hand fall on the switch, turning off the lamp without changing the brightness of the area. He stood still for a few more moments. His body and mind had not fully awakened and took every opportunity to stop and go back to sleep.</p>

<p>He gathered all the strength he had and prepared strong coffee. He went through the cupboards and fridge looking for accompaniments and fruits, and set up a complete and incredibly symmetrical feast for his breakfast.</p>

<p>He sat at the end of a long, wide rectangular table, with his back to the window so as not to blind himself with the light coming through it and to be comfortable. Besides, he enjoyed a nice breeze from behind and a pleasant counter-current of air caused by the nearby cupboards. He could still see all the other chairs. He was at the center and at the end at the same time. That was definitely the best spot.</p>

<p>Finally, he placed the cutlery carefully beside the empty plate and began to move and rearrange what was on the table to ensure symmetry. After a few minutes on the unnecessary task, he gave up and decided to start eating, even a bit unhappy with the color difference between the jelly and butter jars (which shared the center of the table). He served himself with the utmost care to maintain the position of things, relaxed, and let his mind fly with each piece of bread.</p>

<p>The memories, favored by the surroundings, took him to a Christmas party that had happened many years ago. This was still his parents’ house and he could indulge in the futilities of childhood. The rooms were full of relatives and friends eating and drinking and several children running all over. The pleasant traditional end-of-year chaos.</p>

<p>As always, he took care of realigning and redistributing cups, drinks, and sweets as they were consumed. The table (which now received his breakfast) kept the treats properly balanced and distributed, with the minimum of flaws possible. After all, he was still young, he couldn’t push himself too hard. If there were still this type of gathering at home, the organization would be perfect.</p>

<p>- A penny for your thoughts. - His déjà vu was interrupted by a sweet voice greeting him.</p>

<p>Standing at the door, a beautiful girl with brown hair and eyes stared at him. Her body was covered only by a short gray tank top and discreet panties, leaving her legs sensually on display.</p>

<p>- I just went back a few years in time.</p>

<p>- Hmm - The young woman mumbled, going to sit in the chair that was free right to the left, near the young man. - Nostalgia was never really your style.</p>

<p>- I see you don’t know me that well anymore. In the old days, you wouldn’t even need me to tell you what I was thinking.</p>

<p>- You pushed me away, made me distance myself from you. You believed the stories and advice from your family and stopped talking to me. It’s been many years.</p>

<p>- And I still can’t believe I’m seeing you again. I must be very desperate.</p>

<p>The young woman gave him an aggressive look, snorted, and stared at him for a few moments before gently placing her hand on the young man’s hand. He even thought about pulling back, but hesitated.</p>

<p>- A lot has happened. - the young woman tried to comfort.</p>

<p>There was much truth in those words. A lot had happened in recent days. The peaceful and sweet life ceased to exist and chaos took its place. Never had his mind been in such an intense whirlwind and things only seemed to get worse. There was no light at the end of that tunnel, only darkness.</p>
