    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contoscotidianos/2380485">16/07/2010 - During a summer</a></p>

<p>Fifteenth. It was definitely the fifteenth. It was incredible how I always lost count after the tenth, but this time I was sure, it was the fifteenth red car. I might have lost count of the blue and yellow cars, but now things were fine.</p>

<p>This time it had been a good choice, the grays and blacks weren’t even worth trying, the yellows passed too rarely, making it hard to keep the number in my head, now it was much easier, red is the counting frequency, if someday I need something to count, its color will be red.</p>

<p>Hard to keep focus on a sunny day, especially to write an essay. Notebook, pencil, and eraser weren’t made to be used for writing but for drawing, that’s what they were for. Proof of this were the more than five pages scribbled with the best of abstract art.</p>

<p>I hated that situation, a prose text with a free theme. What to do? A dissertation? A thesis? An article? A fiction? A report? And even worse, about what? Free theme? That’s not a theme, it’s torture.</p>

<p>All morning, the only thing I wanted to know was what evil mind would order a prose text with a free theme. When I was about to start writing, the noise the family made caused me to abandon the idea of staying in the room.</p>

<p>Inside the backpack were the faithful notebooks, pencils, and eraser, plus some sandwiches, candies, a chocolate bar, and comic books, just as a source of inspiration.</p>

<p>After much thought, the best choice was to grab the bike and head to the central park, there would be a good place to think, gather facts, and decide what and about what to write. Too bad it couldn’t be a drawing, it would be easier.</p>

<p>Drawing was always free, unlike a text, they weren’t made to be free, I thought at that time. The path helped a lot to think, too bad that when I got there the boys were playing ball, all the small introductory paragraph got lost little by little during the kicks.</p>

<p>I should write, it was already getting late, but creativity disappeared. Time for comics, I knew they would be useful, comics are always useful, reading them would structure the most beautiful stories wrapped in the greatest adventures and with engaging characters.</p>

<p>Hard to believe, but nothing was written. This was the point of counting cars, an extremely exhausting task, requiring a lot of effort and attention. Especially because of the Beetles, they always seem to conspire for failure. Always at the moment when a car of your color is going to turn the corner, a Beetle accelerates making noise, anyone would look at the little Bug.</p>

<p>This was definitely the hardest task of all, how can a young person stop to write? Why do we have to write in Portuguese classes? This was a question that was only answered years later.</p>

<p>Two days later, a Monday, was the deadline for submission, a martyrdom. But fortunately, the teacher liked the letter humbly apologizing for not having written the text. Surprisingly, a great surprise, a letter is also considered a text.</p>
