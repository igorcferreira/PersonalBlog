Writing from the past - A morning

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2024 </span>

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contos-de-amor/2898713">09/04/2011 - A morning</a></p>

<p>The electronic clock lit up at seven o’clock and started playing a strange song about the woes of those who suffer. In the chair beside it, a man was posted in his formal attire, accompanied by an empty whiskey bottle and a full glass that rested in his hand, forgotten by his own body.</p>

<p>He got up, placed the glass on the table next to the clock, capped it, and picked up the bottle. “A beautiful night, my dear Johnny.” He went to the window, opened the old cloth curtain, and saw the great light of the sun beginning to cover the city waking up for another day of hustle.</p>

<p>- Yeah. Looks like this starts again.</p>

<p>He took a few steps back and threw the bottle as far as he could. He still stood for a few seconds waiting to hear the sound of glass shattering twenty floors below, but when nothing happened, he snorted in compliance and returned to the room to reconnect the phone he had disconnected a few hours before.</p>

<p>As soon as the plug finished being inserted into the wall, a red light blinked on a button on the device. Upon pressing it, a mechanized voice extended in information about numbers and dates. Soon after, a slightly hoarse and familiar voice took over.</p>

<p>- Hey. What’s up, man? It’s me, Luiz. Are you there? I can’t reach you on your cell. Call me.</p>

<p>A beep, again the mechanized voice and a new message.</p>

<p>- Man, I’m worried about you. Ana said she saw you leaving a little after the speech. You should be home by now, call me. (beep)</p>

<p>- Hey, I’m downstairs and the doorman doesn’t want to let me in. Show up, let me come up. I know you need to talk to someone. (beep)</p>

<p>- It’s no use closing yourself off now. What happened, happened, there’s no going back. We should go out now, talk, complain, curse so we can laugh again. Sitting there alone isn’t worth it… (beep)</p>

<p>- As I was saying, it’s a great injustice, you and that black label there alone. I know you must have only the dregs left, but it’s always bad not being able to toast a label. I know a place you’ll love. No joke. Remember Evan… (beep)</p>

<p>- Remind me after I get you a new phone. This answering machine of yours gets on my nerves. I’m not going to try to get you out of the house, but use this time to think and, most importantly, forget. Sometimes happiness is in stopping suffering for what happened and paving your way in search of new events. Go… (beep)</p>

<p>He gave up standing there listening to the messages and headed for the kitchen. He grabbed a kettle from the cupboard under the sink and, in the most silence possible, filled it with water and put it on the stove. He heard noises in the hallway and saw a very poorly folded newspaper being passed through the mail slot in the door.</p>

<p>He collected that set of papers, opened them, and saw his photo stamped on the front page, just below a small text that said: “Young student shakes scientific community in lecture on the impact of manipulating basic life structures.”</p>

<p>He flipped through a few pages until he found the complete article, where a journalist with no knowledge of biology described how his speech had caused conversations, discussions, and even fights at the international biotechnology council.</p>

<p>This reading made a small smile appear on his face, but it was soon undone. It seemed that every small moment of calm or happiness made his mind conflict with his heart, bringing the pain stored in memories and driving it deep into his soul.</p>

<p>He noticed that the phone was still spewing messages from his friend and wondered how many more there were. He went back to the kitchen, searched for the coffee pot and found it dirty in the sink, waiting to be washed. He gave up on it, got a glass jar, the filter, coffee, and sugar and left everything ready waiting for the water.</p>

<p>With the coffee ready, he filled a large mug with the hot liquid, grabbed some cookies from a glass jar on top of the fridge, threw himself back in the armchair next to the phone, and busied himself making his stomach stop complaining of hunger.</p>

<p>He was finishing his coffee when the voice coming from the device beside him started to get annoying. He got up and headed decisively to silence the phone, but it wasn’t necessary. The metallic voice returned to inform that the memory was full and no more messages would be stored until action was taken.</p>

<p>Comforted by the news, he sat back down to have some peace before hearing the phone bell ringing insistently. He knew it must be his friend willing to bother again, so he let the device go to the answering machine. But the voice that came out of the phone was not exactly what he expected, making his body freeze and his chest tighten in a sweet pain.</p>

<p>“I understand you don’t want to talk to me, but I also know you’re there, posted next to that armchair of yours that you like so much. - Began a sweet and trembling female voice. - I probably won’t remember this tomorrow, so I hope it’s not being recorded on your answering machine and that you’re not listening. That bottle of champagne you left here is being very useful. It’s a very bad drink, but it helps to think. Very magical.”</p>

<p>“But I’m calling to be able to say what I really wanted to have said. You have no right to ruin your life because of me. It’s not fair! I have nothing but a mediocre life as an assistant in a mediocre office. Asking you to stay would be a very great injustice and I realized this watching your presentation today.”</p>

<p>“And I say this not only because of the many scientists who gave you a standing ovation at the end, but also because of the sparkle in your eyes while you spoke, the smile hidden in the seriousness imposed by the occasion, and the splendor of achievement and success that surrounded you. I can’t let you stop being this perfect figure just to make my heart feel the deepest joy of a fulfilled soul.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ve finished saying everything I had to say and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you hate me in the same way and proportion with which I will always love you.”</p>

<p>- Hating you will be impossible. - The mug that once had coffee was in pieces on the floor and the phone trembled in his hand as he gathered strength to respond. - Every time I see a child’s smile I will remember the sweet pleasure of seeing you smile. Every time I feel the fresh morning breeze my heart will shrink with the memories of the best dawns of my life when I saw you in my arms. And greater injustice is to make two souls cry from a distance while a simple obstacle keeps them apart and suffering.</p>

<p>Both remained in absolute silence while small tears ran down the tired face of the young man who had his whole being focused on the search for his listener while the sun filled the room with welcome for another morning in the daily life of the lovers.</p>

Writing from the past - The string family

      </a>

    <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2024 </span>

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/pensamentos/2844740">08/12/2013 - The string family</a></p>

<p>The string family is very interesting.
The classical double bass is the great elder, and the cello is that older uncle who lives in Europe
with his son violin and his daughter viola.
The acoustic guitar is the country uncle who works the fields with his annoying son, the ukulele.
And the electric guitar and bass are the metropolitan “hipsters.”</p>

Writing from the past - Paulista - Trianon

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2024 </span>

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contoscotidianos/2788451">12/02/2011 - Paulista - Trianon</a></p>

<p>The beat silenced for a few moments and returned in another rhythm. This new song was faster, making her quicken her pace, intensifying the run. Ana Luísa had recently moved to the area and loved the idea of having a space to run every morning.</p>

<p>As always, she woke up early, went to the fridge, grabbed the half of a papaya she had started the day before and an apple and a banana from the fruit bowl. Finally, she went to the cupboard and got the last box of milk, noticing she would need to do shopping next Saturday. She noted this on a post-it and stuck it on the cupboard door.</p>

<p>She washed the fruits and sliced them with skin and all, threw them in the blender and added the milk. She still hadn’t fully gotten used to the taste of the skins in the smoothie, but she had read in a magazine that it was good for health.</p>

<p>She finished her breakfast with a cup of coffee and a slice of bread with cheese, put on her sportswear, grabbed her MP3, selected a playlist that would motivate her to exercise, and left, locking the door behind her.</p>

<p>In the elevator, she took advantage of the mirror to arrange her long black hair in a ponytail well secured with elastics and clips. She noticed she loved those leggings. They were a nice black, comfortable, and had an incredible power to shape her body.</p>

<p>Already on the street, she stopped at the building entrance and spent long minutes stretching. This process helped avoid injuries and served as a final incentive to go out so early. She was in a central area and, even in the first rays of sun, several people passed by in formal clothes or uniforms, carrying their bags and phones.</p>

<p>Ana loved speculating about the professions of those passing by, as well as a bit of their private lives.
Where were they going?
Why were they going?
Which way would they return at the end of the day?
Where would they return to?
All these questions formed little characters that disappeared from the young woman’s mind before clocking in at work.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she would go up a few blocks to the building that had a large number 500 fixed at its entrance on the avenue and would spend her day with drawings, engravings, typography, and other elements of the art department of some fashion magazines. But that was later, now she would go in the opposite direction, toward the park.</p>

<p>She could cut through the parallel streets and go up to the avenue only near her destination. This, in fact, was the easier path, there were fewer people, but she would lose the great movement of people and cars that she loved to see accompanied by the sound of her music. Decided, she checked if her sneakers were well tied and began her walk.</p>

<p>This was her warm-up.
Take a small hill up to the avenue, cross a few blocks, pass in front of the Gazeta building, FIESP, cross the street in front of MASP and finally enter the park, count a few steps and start her jog.
First wandering, but gradually increasing.</p>

<p>She finished her run accompanied by trees and people who pass by there to cut through. At the exit, she stopped at the newsstand in front, there she found the two policemen she always ran into, asked for water, bought some magazines, the newspaper, and took her way back.</p>

<p>She would still stop at the gym on the way home. She would do some exercises for arms, abdomen, and some aerobics, would go home, take a good and long shower, change, and happily and motivated go to work.</p>

<p>Going over the day made her take a deep breath and smile.
An involuntary movement.
When she paid attention to what was happening in front of her, she saw a young man dressed in poorly adjusted formal clothes, walking calmly, as if he had no destination, calmly and slowly.</p>

<p>The young man carried a backpack on his back which he took off and sat near one of the fountains that adorned the base of the museum. Before continuing on her way, Ana still watched long enough to see him pull from the bag a large green book, glasses, headphones, a music player, and prepare to spend some time reading.</p>
