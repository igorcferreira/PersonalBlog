First Third - Day 3

<p>Yesterday, I had dinner at a table with 4 other French speakers, and it was a fruitful dinner! They spent most of the time speaking French, since there was no reason to change the language on my account, especially since most of them don’t speak English.</p>

<p>But it was a very good dinner; Delicious food: A light soup as a starter, meat prepared with fresh tomato sauce, and pudding for dessert.</p>

<p>It was my plan to order coffee after dinner, since it’s my habit, even though it’s late and I have to wake up early the next day. I’ve never had problems sleeping after an espresso, and in many situations, this has even helped me sleep better.</p>

<p>But I didn’t want to be the stranger at the table. Especially since I was offered a “bonne nuit infusion,” brought in the luggage by one of the pilgrims at the table. It seemed like a good idea to join the French on this occasion.</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be wondering why I’m talking about yesterday’s dinner in today’s diary. To answer your questions: I decided to start with this description because today was a VERY easy walking day.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the last post, the effort to make yesterday’s extended walk to Larrasoaña meant I arrived early in Pamplona, despite, as always, having left late.</p>

<p>This time, I started at what would be halfway for most people. So I met many people along the way. MANY PEOPLE. This made me happy with the idea of leaving hotels late. But having most of the day ahead of me showed me the pleasures of long stops along the journey.</p>

<hr>

<p><img src="https://igorcferreira.com/public/river_view.jpg" alt="Travel companion" class="center-image"></p>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Travel companion</figcaption>

<p>Back to describing today’s route: It was an easy walk done, for most of the day, following a beautiful river, being a graceful pleasure to hear the flow of the river and the singing of birds. However, the end of the route is done entirely through three cities: Trinidad de Arre, Burlada, and Pamplona. These being so close that the border between them is imperceptible.</p>

<p><img src="https://igorcferreira.com/public/villava.jpg" alt="Intia building, in Villava" class="center-image"></p>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Intia building, in Villava</figcaption>

<p>A few hours walking through civilization, on sidewalks and streets, with cars, buses, and daily life happening around you. The architecture and colors of the cities are beautiful, but I need the natural scenery.</p>

<p>By the way, in Trinidad de Arre, I saw a girl carrying a HUGE suitcase, with a selfie stick, and playing music on her phone. When I got closer, I had the impression that I knew the song (something that was confirmed in a few minutes, when I passed the person). Skank! Something that hit the nostalgia. Looking more closely at the backpack, I could see the Brazilian flag, and the flag of the city of Tiradentes.</p>

<hr>

<p><img src="https://igorcferreira.com/public/entrance_pamplona.jpg" alt="Entrance to Pamplona" class="center-image"></p>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Entrance to Pamplona</figcaption>

<p>Right at the entrance to Pamplona, I decided to stay one more day in the city. After all, it’s a big city, with tradition, and many places to see. Two of the city’s biggest events are Carnival and the running of the bulls; I’m not a fan of the first, and I’m against the second, so I believe I won’t have many reasons to return to the city.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think it will be nice to spend one more day here, giving me time to calmly walk around the city and see more things. Besides more time to wash clothes, buy stamps, and finally send some postcards I’ve been carrying with me for a while.</p>

First Third - Day 2

<figcaption class="imageCaption">Leaving Roncesvalles</figcaption>

<p>Today, I left the town late. This way, I wouldn’t meet many people on the path. And this was true during the first half of the journey. Before lunch, I only met older people, who walked more slowly and stopped many times to rest.</p>

<p>It’s been a peaceful path! Especially when compared to yesterday. It has its climbs, especially after Burguete, but most of the path is a pleasant straight stretch, with a wonderful view.</p>

<hr>

<p><img src="https://igorcferreira.com/public/bridge_stop.jpg" alt="Rest stop" class="center-image"></p>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Rest stop</figcaption>

<p>I wrote the previous paragraph during a stop, before arriving in Zubiri, and I should add here that I didn’t have as much pleasure for a good part of the day. There was more descent, but with many rocks, forcing me to slow down and think carefully about where I was stepping. This is something that has always bothered me when walking in London (and in most big cities); Having to slow down because of tourists, groups, or people who take up the entire sidewalk when walking.</p>

<p>Another element that somewhat hindered the end of the day was the decision to follow a “guidebook,” which suggested continuing the walk after Zubiri, based on a decision of a shorter walk the next day, and being able to spend more time in Pamplona. I’m as tired as yesterday, if not more. But we’ll see if it was a good decision or not.</p>

<p>Given these points, it was a peaceful day. I met again the 2 Brazilians and the 2 Irish people I met yesterday. They left the town early, but my slower pace allowed me to “cross paths” with them once again. Apparently, I’ll see them several times throughout the entire journey.</p>

<hr>

<p><img src="https://igorcferreira.com/public/green_hills.jpg" alt="View from the trail" class="center-image"></p>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">View from the trail</figcaption>

<p>My eyes loved the trail, and my legs are mocking my shoulders. The poor things aren’t used to carrying a loaded backpack for hours. However, I can easily walk for a few more hours (without the backpack) before going to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’m an introvert, and I’m spending most of the day in complete silence, only with my thoughts, and I’m very happy with that. That’s what I came for. I’m just afraid of ending up liking the experience of isolation too much.</p>

<p>Something I could notice, however, was the way I direct myself to people, when it’s something not related to work: Shy, passive at the beginning of conversation, and resilient to “offending” throughout the conversation, becoming more silent. I see that it pushes some people away, and irritates (even if slightly) some others.</p>

I'd like to say I don't know how to use the internet!

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jul 2017 </span>

    <p>I recently moved to Barcelona and, due to Spanish bureaucracy, I can’t sign long-term contracts (apart from my rental contract). Because of this, one fact permeates my life: I don’t have internet at home, and I have a mobile plan with limited data.</p>

<p>This causes a life change: I can’t use the internet outside of work, beyond text messages. And, honestly, it was something very good. Because it proved one thing to me: I don’t know how to use the internet.</p>

<p>The internet is a sensational tool that enables the interconnection of processing and storage units around the world. With this, access to information is facilitated, as is processing and analysis of that information!</p>

<p>But in our daily reality, that’s not what the internet is used for… Rather, it’s for entertainment: Series, random videos, cat gifs, etc.</p>

<p>As someone who uses the internet to keep in touch with family and friends who live in other countries, I put myself in a pretty bad situation. YouTube video after YouTube video. Millions of series on the playlist. A long list of comics to read.</p>

<p>But little literary reading of greater complexity (I love comics, but the reduced volume doesn’t allow for great philosophical work, like books do); Little technical reading; And, mainly, closing myself off to the online world.</p>

<p>Barcelona is a city that invites you to leave your apartment. Beautiful weather, impressive architecture, inviting beach, and WONDERFUL food. Yet, I would spend some afternoons reviewing PRs that spilled over from the workday, series after series, YouTube videos after YouTube videos…</p>

<p>Entertaining yourself with these art forms isn’t a problem. But I believe it’s valid to load your e-reader with publications and sit by the boardwalk to read; Walk to the cinema to watch a session of a local film; Have a beer while listening to live music.</p>

<p>Know how to use the internet as a tool for accessing information, not as a socialization tool! :)</p>
