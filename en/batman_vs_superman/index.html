          <p>Keep in mind that this review is brought to you by a big fan of DC and Vertigo comics, especially <em>Justice League Dark</em>, <em>The Sandman</em>, <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>HellBlazer</em>, <em>Blackest Night</em>, <em>Green Arrow</em>, <em>Trinity War</em>, <em>The Killing Joke</em>, <em>Fables</em>, and other comics that aren’t afraid to touch on controversial subjects, bring strong images, and release volumes rated <a href="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/ratings/d/d5/ESRB-ver2013_M.png">M</a>.</p>
          <p>The same goes for my favorite Marvel comics, such as <em>DareDevil</em>, <em>Blade</em>, <em>The Punisher</em>, <em>Old Man Logan</em>, <em>Alias</em>, etc.</p>
          <p>I could keep listing several others, from other publishers, like <em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>Lazarus</em>, and <em>Spawn</em> from <a href="https://imagecomics.com">Image Comics</a>. But maybe someday I’ll write a post just to talk about that.</p>
          <p><strong>I liked the movie!</strong></p>
          <p>More extreme points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This movie showed, once again, why I don’t use Rotten Tomatoes as a criterion for deciding whether or not to watch a movie.</li>
            <li>If you’re bashing this movie and liked Age of Ultron: Congratulations on being an irrational Marvel fan.</li>
            <li>The way DC chose to build their cinematic universe is VERY different from the way Marvel chose.</li>
            <li>And: This is a movie made for Easter! There’s no shortage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">Easter Eggs</a>!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Oh, important:</p>

          <h2>Universe</h2>
          <p>This is not Christopher Nolan’s Batman, nor Christopher Reeve’s Superman, nor Lynda Carter’s Wonder Woman! It continues what started in <em>Man of Steel</em>:</p>
          <p>Here, Kal-El breaks necks, Bruce stabs people in the chest, and Princess Diana prefers to hide rather than have her image revealed to the world of men.</p>
          <p>Warner made it clear that the movie universe was going to be something new when they announced they wouldn’t mix series and movies. And even clearer when they showed the most overpowered superhero in history with his underwear inside the uniform!</p>
          <p>DC’s extended universe was launched in Man of Steel, but this was the first movie that makes it clear, through the appearance of the trinity. And, like the first movie, it brings a much darker environment.</p>
          <p>Another thing that emphasizes this was the assassination of photographer James Olsen, the fact that Bruce Wayne has already been Batman for 20 years and has no qualms about killing the criminals who get in his way.</p>
          <p>One of the reviews I read about the movie pointed out that the movie didn’t have many jokes, as a bad thing. It’s necessary to understand that this isn’t the idea! When Barry Allen shows up, we can start thinking about jokes. Until then, the seriousness, trauma, and the weight of defending the world is what drives the universe.</p>
          <p>I believe this is the ideal tone for DC! And this is the environment where I want to see Zatanna, Constantine, Hal Jordan, Black Hand, Brainiac…</p>
          <h2>Movie (General)</h2>
          <p>Dawn of Justice is a continuation of Man of Steel, showing how the world is getting used to the idea of living with an alien who destroyed an entire city.</p>
          <p>And this idea of impotence and impunity is what leads Bruce Wayne to the project of destroying Clark Kent. But, from the beginning of the movie, you can see that the battle between the heroes is just one round in the fight against Lex Luthor.</p>
          <p>In comic arcs, it’s a mix of Dark Knight Returns, The Death of Superman, Forever Evil, Justice League #1, and Injustice.</p>
          <p>I believe the script and CGI made the fights and deaths make sense. The plot created by Lex to question Superman’s role in society with the aim of gaining access to weapons and ways to eliminate the “new god.”</p>
          <p>I agree with some criticism of director Zack Snyder, especially in the presentation of the meta-humans that make up the Justice League and in the passages that serve as connections to the other movies in the universe.</p>
          <h2>Super powered batman</h2>
          <p>“They’re coming, now that they know God is dead.” This line from Lex Luthor at the end of the movie is disappointing!</p>
          <p>Justice League #1 and Injustice were placed in the movie through Bruce Wayne’s dreams. Here, it seems Batman has a connection between two worlds. And in this second world, Superman stopped being nice and allied with Darkseid to unleash evil.</p>
          <p>And this Batman with psychic powers was quite strange and deviated from what you expect from the knight. This arc, within the movie, was something I really thought was pretty bad.</p>
