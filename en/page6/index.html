Writing from the past - Photos

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/pensamentos/2385723">18/07/2010 - Photos</a></p>

<p>I’ve heard and seen in some productions that Eastern culture, with the introduction of the camera, repudiated the photo for fear that the device was capable of absorbing and imprisoning the soul.</p>

<p>We all know this isn’t true, but I find it incredible how photography has power in many situations. Sometimes when someone picks up a photo from another person’s trip, they find it grotesque how the individual agrees to pose with a blank expression, but whoever is in that photo and whoever took it is swept with memories and feelings.</p>

<p>An image may not be able to keep your soul, but it carries within it various feelings and “ghosts,” using them against people with surgical precision. It puts its hand on your heart and caresses it or squeezes it as if the two were the same thing.</p>

<p>This is a power that only still images have, since they require your creativity and memories for the steps to be retraced, besides giving you a clear and vivid description of what it’s about.</p>

<p>It’s possible to revisit shapes, colors, and mainly, looks. Like those of your best childhood friend, your first school crush, your first disagreement with that person you haven’t seen for years.</p>

<p>These tools can capture from infrared to the clearest rainbow, but beyond that, they can capture moments.</p>

Writing from the past - During a summer

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contoscotidianos/2380485">16/07/2010 - During a summer</a></p>

<p>Fifteenth. It was definitely the fifteenth. It was incredible how I always lost count after the tenth, but this time I was sure, it was the fifteenth red car. I might have lost count of the blue and yellow cars, but now things were fine.</p>

<p>This time it had been a good choice, the grays and blacks weren’t even worth trying, the yellows passed too rarely, making it hard to keep the number in my head, now it was much easier, red is the counting frequency, if someday I need something to count, its color will be red.</p>

<p>Hard to keep focus on a sunny day, especially to write an essay. Notebook, pencil, and eraser weren’t made to be used for writing but for drawing, that’s what they were for. Proof of this were the more than five pages scribbled with the best of abstract art.</p>

<p>I hated that situation, a prose text with a free theme. What to do? A dissertation? A thesis? An article? A fiction? A report? And even worse, about what? Free theme? That’s not a theme, it’s torture.</p>

<p>All morning, the only thing I wanted to know was what evil mind would order a prose text with a free theme. When I was about to start writing, the noise the family made caused me to abandon the idea of staying in the room.</p>

<p>Inside the backpack were the faithful notebooks, pencils, and eraser, plus some sandwiches, candies, a chocolate bar, and comic books, just as a source of inspiration.</p>

<p>After much thought, the best choice was to grab the bike and head to the central park, there would be a good place to think, gather facts, and decide what and about what to write. Too bad it couldn’t be a drawing, it would be easier.</p>

<p>Drawing was always free, unlike a text, they weren’t made to be free, I thought at that time. The path helped a lot to think, too bad that when I got there the boys were playing ball, all the small introductory paragraph got lost little by little during the kicks.</p>

<p>I should write, it was already getting late, but creativity disappeared. Time for comics, I knew they would be useful, comics are always useful, reading them would structure the most beautiful stories wrapped in the greatest adventures and with engaging characters.</p>

<p>Hard to believe, but nothing was written. This was the point of counting cars, an extremely exhausting task, requiring a lot of effort and attention. Especially because of the Beetles, they always seem to conspire for failure. Always at the moment when a car of your color is going to turn the corner, a Beetle accelerates making noise, anyone would look at the little Bug.</p>

<p>This was definitely the hardest task of all, how can a young person stop to write? Why do we have to write in Portuguese classes? This was a question that was only answered years later.</p>

<p>Two days later, a Monday, was the deadline for submission, a martyrdom. But fortunately, the teacher liked the letter humbly apologizing for not having written the text. Surprisingly, a great surprise, a letter is also considered a text.</p>

Writing from the past - The text

    <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/pensamentos/2380117">15/07/2010 - The Text</a></p>

<p>I’ve read a lot about the ability and art of writing, but I learned little from it. There are many texts that talk about how to divide paragraphs, how to delimit the theme, how to divide the acts, and when to interrupt an event, but they weren’t capable of making me write.</p>

<p>It was when, flipping through a book about audiovisual, I read a small phrase loose in the middle of the page: “For the story to be a story, it’s necessary that the characters have life, it’s necessary that the facts occur by themselves, without the interference of the author.”</p>

<p>This small excerpt marked my thoughts, I slept many days with that in my head and to this day I can’t remember what book it was and who the author was, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I know I’m not good at this, but it’s great therapy. The attempt to create lives and events, making them get out of your control to the point of hating the antagonist and rooting for the protagonist while your fingers touch the keys, is magical.</p>
