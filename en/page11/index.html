Queen's Land <abbr title="United Kingdom">🇬🇧</abbr>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2016 </span>

    <p><img src="http://wiki.mindseyesociety.org/images/thumb/5/5d/London-england-at-night-banner-no-logo.jpg/850px-London-england-at-night-banner-no-logo.jpg" alt="Congress"></p>

<p>The first winter I’ve spent in the Queen’s land has come to an end, and I believe I’ve had time to get somewhat acquainted with the city! <i>(For those of you who imagined I would talk about the region in northeastern Australia or the Indian park, I apologize)</i></p>

<p>The life change to London wasn’t easy. Even more so coming here alone, without family and friends. Something that was alleviated by the great colleagues I have at work and by my cousin who already lived here.</p>

<p>I didn’t have time to be a tourist, I started working (a lot) on my second day here, I’m already exchanging letters with the government to balance a year of taxes, and I’m a great example of introverts, so I can’t give a complete view of the city, but I can give you my view of this beautiful place:</p>

<h1 id="a-city-for-everyone">A city for everyone</h1>

<p>The first thing that impresses in London (as in many cities in Europe) is the mix of old and new. In architecture, art, and even culture.</p>

<p>But something that’s very clear is that London is a city for everyone. Here, anyone can find their “tribe,” regardless of which cultural movement they belong to.</p>

<p>Clubs, music, street art, parks, museums, libraries, universities, etc. You can do whatever you want and learn new things.</p>

<h1 id="the-world-is-here">The world is here</h1>

<p>This multicultural city clearly came together thanks to the language, the country’s history, the economy, and participation in the European Union. Because here, you hear every language in the world.</p>

<p>London is a city powered by immigrants. This is constantly a topic of political debates and, sometimes, xenophobia, but it’s a truth. The biggest proof is the restaurants. One thing I love is how easy it is to find any type of food!</p>

<h1 id="pub-culture">Pub culture</h1>

<p><img src="http://www.english-blogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/uk-fullerspub.jpg" alt="" class="center-image"></p>

<p>I love gastronomy and beer, and this is a very good city for both. Especially for the famous happy hour!</p>

<p>The country has a pub culture. A Londoner drinks a lot of beer! This is a fact. Thus, you find a pub on every corner, with ale on tap and lager aplenty. It’s easy to see pubs busy at breakfast, lunch, and late afternoon. With groups of friends drinking wine, beer, cider, tomato juice, or some other drink.</p>

<h1 id="coffee-shops">Coffee shops</h1>

<p><img src="http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Phone-box-coffee-595709.jpg" alt="Coffee shops" class="center-image"></p>

<p>It’s not just beer that moves London, we also have coffee and, of course, tea! The amount of tea a British person drinks is ridiculous. The kettle is always boiling water, all day long, especially in offices.</p>

<p>That’s why, just like pubs, it’s very easy to find a coffee shop. Big brands like Costa and Nero share space with smaller, more artisanal places. And no, there aren’t as many Starbucks as in NY, or even São Paulo. The brand is even hated by some.</p>

<h1 id="weather">Weather</h1>

<p><img src="https://kniftonholdingcourt.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/wpid-img_5055690190826.jpeg?w=620" alt="Weather" class="center-image"></p>

<p>One thing that’s a recurring topic here (and taken very seriously) is the weather! Something that can be summed up as: awful!</p>

<p>Many take vitamin D and use S.A.D. lamps to survive the constant rain, gray skies, and winter with darkness falling at 4 in the afternoon.</p>

<h1 id="house">House</h1>

<p><img src="http://www.inciteinteriors.co.uk/images/ww/Golive-Images/Slipper%20Satin%20Painted%20and%20Walnut%20kitchen.jpg" alt="Kitchen" class="center-image"></p>

<p>Now, there are things you only notice when you’ve been here for a while, or if you plan to stay here for a while. The first and most significant is the price of housing in London. Which is absurdly expensive. Really!</p>

<p>Also, there are some characteristics of British residences that are quite different from Brazilian ones. Things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Power outlet
<img src="http://f.tqn.com/y/gouk/1/0/Q/1/-/-/wall.jpg" alt="Power outlet" class="center-image"></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heating

</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Washing machine in the kitchen

</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clothesline inside the house
<img src="http://spartanandhannah.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/built-in-clothes-line-from-third-floor-stairs-web.jpg" alt="Clothesline" class="center-image"></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="self-checkout">Self checkout</h1>

<p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2013/10/04/checkout.jpg?x=1200&amp;y=794" alt="Self checkout" class="center-image"></p>

<p>Another thing that’s quite different is shopping. Unlike São Paulo, shopping is usually done at pound stores and neighborhood markets. Not at giant supermarkets. Places like Sainsbury’s and Tesco.</p>

<p>Now, one phenomenal thing is self checkout. All smaller supermarkets have terminals where you can scan items and pay without needing an attendant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Self checkout + Contactless = <abbr title="love">❤️</abbr></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="contactless">Contactless</h1>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Universal_Contactless_Card_Symbol.svg/1280px-Universal_Contactless_Card_Symbol.svg.png" alt="Contactless" class="center-image"></p>

<p>Along with self checkout, something that helps a lot is contactless payment. This is a system that uses NFC on your debit card and allows you to make payments without having to enter your PIN.</p>

<p>This way, you can quickly pay for small purchases, metro (underground), and buses. You can even use devices with contactless payment (iPhone, Apple Watch, etc). Never again go through the situation of not having credit on your travel card.</p>

<h1 id="public-system">Public system</h1>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/London_Underground_Interior_Jubilee_line.jpg" alt="Underground" class="center-image"></p>

<p>One thing that works beautifully is the British public system. At least, the services I’ve needed!</p>

<p>Complete and punctual public transport (just not cheap); The health system is punctual and efficient (but a bit confusing); Efficient and friendly police and surveillance system.</p>

<h1 id="cost-of-living">Cost of living</h1>

<p><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02854/ed_2854911b.jpg" alt="" class="center-image"></p>

<p>The city isn’t perfect for several reasons. But one of the strongest is the cost of living!</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, the cost to rent/buy a residence is absurd. Many people share apartments, renting a room. And in the center, rent can reach £1000 per week (No, I didn’t make a mistake, it’s per week).</p>

<p>Earning in pounds helps a lot, especially when traveling around Europe. Since the currency is well-valued worldwide. But when you arrive in the city and spend a month paying bills in reais, it really hurts the wallet.</p>

<h1 id="bedtime">Bedtime</h1>

<p><img src="http://www.tradingwinner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sorry-we-are-closed.jpg" alt="" class="center-image"></p>

<p>Another thing that bothers a paulista a lot is how early the city closes. I still haven’t managed to adjust my life schedule to the city.</p>

<p>I always started work late and worked until late because, in São Paulo, I could, after 9 PM, stop by the mall to buy some things, stop at a restaurant and supermarket before going home.</p>

<p>You know that paulista thing of pre-drinking until midnight and then going to a club? Here, by 8 PM things are already closing. The official closing time for pubs is 11 PM!!!</p>

<p>I went to a Nightwish concert here and couldn’t find anything open to have dinner afterwards… Traumatic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d like to mention that I know there are many clubs that stay open until 4 AM</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="lunch">Lunch</h1>

<p>Something I thought was part of the culture of the company I work for, but later discovered isn’t, is how lunchtime works.</p>

<p>Normally, people buy what they’re going to eat (sandwiches or complete meals) and eat in front of the computer, at their desks.</p>

<p>For someone who used to spend 2 hours at lunch at a table, with friends, having a beer, it’s something, at the very least, strange.</p>

<h1 id="winter-blue">Winter blue</h1>

<p>I’d like to emphasize that <a href="http://www.dailyedge.ie/penguins-antidepressants-weather-1306136-Feb2014/">the weather is really bad</a> in London. So bad that people who come from tropical countries are recommended to get vitamin D injections from time to time.</p>

<p>Something that affects many people (myself included) is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">winter blue</a>.</p>

<p>The lack of sun affects people’s psychology, who start to have much more drowsiness and symptoms similar to depression. It can even lead to depression.</p>

<p>It’s something I went through and, honestly, it’s pretty bad! In fact, this post should have come out on February 2nd. But I was so unwell last month that I couldn’t write a single line.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I think this covers some points I wanted to cover about my time in London <em>so far</em>. If you have any questions, just send a tweet to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@igorcferreira">@igorcferreira@mastodon.social</a> and I can answer questions.</p>

🎄 2015

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jan 2016 </span>

    <p>For years, my New Year’s resolutions have amounted to:</p>

<p>`
Goals for year n:
Prepare goals for year n+1
`</p>

<p>I never planned anything more than a month ahead. To be honest, I never planned anything in my life.</p>

<p>I believe the main factors for this (among many) are: my lack of ambition, detachment from many things, and the security I have in family and friends.</p>

<p>I’ve always had the freedom to take risks and do what I thought I wanted to do (something I didn’t take advantage of as I should have), knowing that if something went wrong, I would have friendly shoulders to turn to. This allowed me to try various things, like music, theatre, electronics, game development, etc. As well as various trips and job changes. ^^</p>

<p><em>This, however, did not exclude my “shyness” and the profile categorized by many as introverted, which accompanies me.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-changed-in-2015">What changed in 2015</h2>
<hr>

<p>As the ad would say, everything changed. 2015 was a year where my life took a big turn.</p>

<p>The main one happened like everything else in my life, with the support of family and friends: I moved to London, where I got a job at <a href="http://futureworkshops.com/">Future Workshops</a>. I admit that the decision to take this step was not easy (in fact, I had been postponing this step for a long time).</p>

<p>What made me look at, consider, and accept this change was the year 2015. This year, more trips, where I talked with 3 companies outside Brazil about the possibility of leaving the country. This, added to the economic situation of the country, made me decide.</p>

<p>I received criticism for this decision from a few people and most were happy that I took this step, always reminding me that homesickness would be strong, and indeed, it weighs heavily. DAILY (but that will be a topic for another day)!</p>

<h2 id="and-christmas">And Christmas?</h2>
<hr>

<p>It was a very busy, rushed year. So, as always, I didn’t think, I just went through it doing what makes me comfortable and happy. It was the Christmas period that caught me by surprise, mainly for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I arrived at the end of the year with some money to spend.</li>
  <li>I would have to take 7 days off before the end of the year.</li>
  <li>I decided to visit the county where my grandfather was born.</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to take a small trip through multiple cities in Spain (Manilva, Málaga, Madrid and, later added, Barcelona). As always, staying in hostels and walking a lot around the city.</p>

<p>There, several times, I was mistaken for a native and people would come ask me questions about the city and daily life in Spanish, something that was VERY difficult, more than it should have been.</p>

<p>And, at the end of the trip, I didn’t have mom to see and tell how it went (by phone it’s not the same thing).</p>

<p>I tried to explain here what made me rethink how I’m facing my life. And I don’t know if I was successful, but it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Finally, I thought, rethought, and fulfilled the 2015 resolutions:</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2016">Goals for 2016</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li>Learn basic Spanish and practice understanding/speaking the language, to be able to make basic communications.</li>
  <li>Learn/practice riding a bicycle to be able to use it, at least, as a form of entertainment.</li>
  <li>Run at least one 5K race, one 10K, and one +10K</li>
  <li>Do a health check-up and readjust my diet to get below 80 kg.</li>
  <li>Look for a new apartment.</li>
  <li>Realign an investment and savings plan that consumes between 5% and 15% of net salary.</li>
  <li>Study a technology in depth, prepare and post content related to that technology.</li>
</ul>
