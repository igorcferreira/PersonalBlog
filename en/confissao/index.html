          <p>October 31</p>
          <p>Hello,</p>
          <p>It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other, a long time indeed. You may not remember me, no problem, I know I’m not a very memorable person. It might even be a big surprise that this text arrives, which is more likely.</p>
          <p>If this page is declared champion, it will probably be the twentieth letter I’ve tried to write, I can’t be sure because I’ve already lost count, if my mother hasn’t picked up some paper from the floor, it’s the twentieth. I think since the first time I spoke to you, this is my most complicated task, words escape me.</p>
          <p>I’m no longer the same shy person I was before, although I still carry this with me, I’m just not very good with words, I’ve always been a better listener than speaker. At least on paper, things are easier, for sure if someday I bump into you on the street, I’ll only be able to smile and say hi, besides turning red like a tomato.</p>
          <p>Possibly that would be the happiest day of my life since high school. I know it’s kind of depressing, actually very depressing, but I haven’t had many life experiences, my parties were reading Freud accompanied by a good hot chocolate.</p>
          <p>I’m writing all this to be able to confess, despite the long introduction, that’s what this letter is for, to free myself from a ghost. Countless were the times I rehearsed, asked some people for help, and created hopes, without reaching the act, lack of courage, that’s why, in fact, I’m doing this through a letter.</p>
          <p>I find it funny that this martyrdom of mine started with a photo. I was rummaging through my closets trying to make room for suits. Yes, now I have to wear suits, job requirement. In a hidden box were all the photos of the class from the old school, from fifth to eighth grade, exactly the time we studied together.</p>
          <p>That was extremely strong for me, it was like living all that time again, I felt that wonderful pain again, a feeling I missed so much and, at the same time, wished to lose. I still haven’t been able to separate myself from the photos, they’re in front of me, scattered on my desk.</p>
          <p>Too bad I never had the courage to take a photo by your side, this is one of my biggest regrets. I couldn’t resist and went after the people online, but I don’t have your email. I managed to find some social networking pages of yours, including a photoblog.</p>
          <p>Seeing this photoblog was the climax, seeing that your life is good, you’re good, and your eyes still have a superhuman beauty, full of life and shine. I couldn’t push away from my chest this thing that tortures me.</p>
          <p>It’s in the attempt to push away my executioner that I write to you. I want to see if by getting rid of my biggest regret, I can put my head on the pillow and go back to sleep without dreaming of you and how my life could have been if, at that time, I had had the courage to face the truth.</p>
          <p>Please don’t be frightened, I’m not a stalker or someone who spent their life obsessed. As I said, it was the photos that made all this come back to my heart. It had been about four years since I hadn’t suffered this way, since that June festival, the one you won’t remember.</p>
          <p>I chose this day because it was a date you really liked, I hope you still maintain this passion. It was a great inspiration. Stopping to try to remember the reason for the affection with this date, I remembered everything you were to me.</p>
          <p>I’ve already made clear what led me to this, I think. But I’ll never be able to completely say what I feel, this is one of the few things I’m sure of. I’ll try to finish soon, my chest won’t hold out much longer, it’s already very tight, my heart begs for mercy.</p>
          <p>I was in love with you. This sentence is even strange to my eyes, my heart shouts to the seven winds this truth, but my brain can’t agree, I have no way of saying this because I never liked someone again the way I liked you, I think I don’t know what love is.</p>
          <p>Sincerely, A sufferer.</p>
          <p>Igor Castañeda Ferreira</p>
