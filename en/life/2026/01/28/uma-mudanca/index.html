    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2026 </span>

    <p>11 years ago I was moving from São Paulo to London.
And 9 years ago I wrote the post <a href="/en/life/2017/03/28/so-long/">So long… Thanks for all the fish!</a>,
where I talked about my move from London to Barcelona.</p>

<p>Now, a new change is happening in my life. At the end of March, I say goodbye to <a href="https://futureworkshops.com">Future Workshops</a>,
a company where I’ve worked for the last 10 years. A decade that ends.</p>

<p>I say goodbye because the company has reached a point where I no longer identify with it. The projects, the clients, the challenges,
and the day-to-day are no longer the same. The strategy of investing in the Saudi Arabia market, and the consequences
of that investment, no longer make me comfortable being at the company.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this investment, I wrote the post <a href="/en/life/2020/05/17/assexualidade">Asexuality</a>, and the desire to write
that post came, in part, from the change in reality that is being involved in Saudi Arabian culture. For years I tried
to understand the consequences and what was happening, and in the last 2 years I tried to motivate the company to end/change
the relationship with the region. Now, it’s my moment to distance myself.</p>

<p>I still really like the people who work at the company, in London and Barcelona, and ending this relationship was
not an easy decision, since I would like to still work with this team. But, in fact,
it’s my moment to distance myself.</p>

<p>You, who read this here, and are not related to the company nor know the company, must be wondering: “And what does this have to do with me?”</p>

<p>My answer to you is: I don’t know.</p>

<p>I just wanted to write and publish my thought. Especially since, now, comes the biggest question: And what do I do now?</p>

<p>My job was a big factor for my staying in Barcelona. Living in Europe has great benefits.
But I feel alone. I didn’t make friendships outside of work, and my family is an ocean away.
It’s time to decide if staying in Europe is still an option. And even if I stay in Europe,
whether staying in Barcelona is a good option.</p>

<p>I believe I’ll write again when I’ve decided, but I wanted to write that I need to think.</p>
