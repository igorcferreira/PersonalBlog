OK, if you’re still here, it’s because you intend to continue reading.
So, here we go:</p>

<hr>

<p>The last post I put on this site was about Asexuality.
Now, I come to post something that is related to this topic, but not necessarily directly: body image.
I’m using the term in English because I don’t know what the exact translation is for this concept.
Besides, I don’t want the focus to be on the term, I’ll focus more on the feelings that surround this concept and how it impacted me,
impacts me, and will still impact me a bit more.</p>

<p>I have a mental idea of “me” that doesn’t correspond to what I see in the mirror.
I’ve felt this way for a long time, I’ve always accepted this idea and continued with my life.
I’d like to point out here that it’s not the same challenge that a transgender person goes through,
I accept that I am the same gender that my body presents.
It’s just that the proportions and boundaries of my body have always seemed to me, in some way, wrong.</p>

<p>During adolescence and young adult life, I blamed the fact that I was too thin.
Nowadays, I blame the fact that I’m a bit chubbier and out of shape.
Never exactly “right” and having as the only common factor that I never knew exactly what that “right” would be.
I never wanted to be very strong/defined, I think too much muscle is something kind of strange (regardless of gender);
But at the same time, I don’t believe being thin/skinny is correct either.</p>

<p>I think it’s important to emphasize here that I have no problem with my body on a day-to-day basis,
but when I see myself in photos/mirror I can’t exactly see that person as “me.”
Something similar to when you hear your own voice in a recording for the first time:
“You know it’s you, but that voice sounds strange.
Everyone around you may be used to that voice, and still, to you, it sounds strange.”</p>

<p>I’m an introverted person, who doesn’t go to parties much, and travels alone.
Therefore, photos of me (even more so when I started living alone) are rarities.
And because they’re rarities, I kept “refusing” to take photos,
to the point where I would get angry when someone took a photo of me, or asked to take a photo of me.
Just like introversion and social phobia, I hide during events, but always uncomfortable and never wanting to see the result.</p>

<p><img src="https://igorcferreira.com/public/IMG_0002.jpg" alt="Me, standing" class="center-image"></p>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">This is the person I can't accept is me</figcaption>

<p>A fact about me: If I’m at home, alone, I’m always naked,
because I find clothes somewhat uncomfortable and being naked is more comfortable.
So, for a moment, I thought it was clothes that brought this questioning to my mind.
But, after much thought, I don’t think so; since seeing myself in the mirror, even naked,
still bothers me (although I don’t care at all about being naked).
And this reinforces the idea that it’s not a discomfort with my body itself,
because I don’t care how I actually look (how neat my beard is, or hair, or the clothes I’m wearing, etc).
Because I never wanted to “please” anyone’s gaze, just wear what I like,
the same way I believe all people are free to wear whatever they want
(this part I believe is more related to asexuality).</p>

<p>During the pandemic, I started frequenting nudist beaches in Barcelona and near Barcelona more often.
For two main reasons: There’s a nudist beach in Sitges that has waves (something I miss from the beaches of Brazil),
and the beaches are generally emptier.
I believe this is a privilege of being a man,
since there are many perverts who go to this type of beach to “see naked women”
(more noticeable/common among tourists here in Barcelona) and it’s safer for me to go to these beaches
(but that’s a tangent for another day).
And these trips to nudist beaches, again, raised this old question that I don’t care
how my body looks to other people, I don’t care how I see other people’s bodies, but,
for some reason, I care about how I see my body.</p>

<p>This questioning even kept me awake at night.
And because of that, I decided to do a bit of “shock therapy,”
taking multiple selfies of myself, with my phone and with a more “professional” camera.
Both clothed and naked.
To try to get used to the sight or, at least,
understand what creates this disconnect between what I think of me and what I see/am.</p>

<p><img src="https://igorcferreira.com/public/IMG_0001.jpg" alt="Image of me, without clothes, sitting on a bench" class="center-image"></p>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">This is the body I don't mind showing, but can't see</figcaption>

<p>Part of this shock therapy was creating a secondary account on Reddit and looking for non-“pornographic” nudity content/subreddits,
to try to see if I could create an idea of what I understand as “ideal”
(p.s.: finding this type of content of men is complicated, 99% of the content is penis photos).
And, in the few subreddits I found, I tried to post some of my photos to get feedback,
although in these communities there’s no one who will “criticize” you, so there’s no real feedback.
Another part of this shock therapy is this post.
Putting this thought and photos out there for “close” people virtually,
so that my soul can relax a little knowing that something has been said.</p>

<p>That’s it. That was the afternoon thought.</p>
