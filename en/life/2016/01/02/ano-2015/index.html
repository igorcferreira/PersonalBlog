🎄 2015

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jan 2016 </span>

    <p>For years, my New Year’s resolutions have amounted to:</p>

<p>`
Goals for year n:
Prepare goals for year n+1
`</p>

<p>I never planned anything more than a month ahead. To be honest, I never planned anything in my life.</p>

<p>I believe the main factors for this (among many) are: my lack of ambition, detachment from many things, and the security I have in family and friends.</p>

<p>I’ve always had the freedom to take risks and do what I thought I wanted to do (something I didn’t take advantage of as I should have), knowing that if something went wrong, I would have friendly shoulders to turn to. This allowed me to try various things, like music, theatre, electronics, game development, etc. As well as various trips and job changes. ^^</p>

<p><em>This, however, did not exclude my “shyness” and the profile categorized by many as introverted, which accompanies me.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-changed-in-2015">What changed in 2015</h2>
<hr>

<p>As the ad would say, everything changed. 2015 was a year where my life took a big turn.</p>

<p>The main one happened like everything else in my life, with the support of family and friends: I moved to London, where I got a job at <a href="http://futureworkshops.com/">Future Workshops</a>. I admit that the decision to take this step was not easy (in fact, I had been postponing this step for a long time).</p>

<p>What made me look at, consider, and accept this change was the year 2015. This year, more trips, where I talked with 3 companies outside Brazil about the possibility of leaving the country. This, added to the economic situation of the country, made me decide.</p>

<p>I received criticism for this decision from a few people and most were happy that I took this step, always reminding me that homesickness would be strong, and indeed, it weighs heavily. DAILY (but that will be a topic for another day)!</p>

<h2 id="and-christmas">And Christmas?</h2>
<hr>

<p>It was a very busy, rushed year. So, as always, I didn’t think, I just went through it doing what makes me comfortable and happy. It was the Christmas period that caught me by surprise, mainly for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I arrived at the end of the year with some money to spend.</li>
  <li>I would have to take 7 days off before the end of the year.</li>
  <li>I decided to visit the county where my grandfather was born.</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to take a small trip through multiple cities in Spain (Manilva, Málaga, Madrid and, later added, Barcelona). As always, staying in hostels and walking a lot around the city.</p>

<p>There, several times, I was mistaken for a native and people would come ask me questions about the city and daily life in Spanish, something that was VERY difficult, more than it should have been.</p>

<p>And, at the end of the trip, I didn’t have mom to see and tell how it went (by phone it’s not the same thing).</p>

<p>I tried to explain here what made me rethink how I’m facing my life. And I don’t know if I was successful, but it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Finally, I thought, rethought, and fulfilled the 2015 resolutions:</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2016">Goals for 2016</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li>Learn basic Spanish and practice understanding/speaking the language, to be able to make basic communications.</li>
  <li>Learn/practice riding a bicycle to be able to use it, at least, as a form of entertainment.</li>
  <li>Run at least one 5K race, one 10K, and one +10K</li>
  <li>Do a health check-up and readjust my diet to get below 80 kg.</li>
  <li>Look for a new apartment.</li>
  <li>Realign an investment and savings plan that consumes between 5% and 15% of net salary.</li>
  <li>Study a technology in depth, prepare and post content related to that technology.</li>
</ul>
