<p>Once again I went to San Francisco to participate (initially) in <a href="http://altconf.com">AltConf</a>. This year was a bit different: Besides the 12-hour direct flight, seeing Brazilian colleagues/friends again was different and I traveled with several coworkers. It was a different experience from previous trips to SF.</p>

<p>As always, the conferences managed to make me hate my personality! I’m absurdly introverted and, therefore, don’t take 100% advantage of the opportunities given to me to build new friendships/contacts. And at the end of the day, I’m left with the feeling that I don’t dedicate myself/study as I should, being merely mediocre in my career.</p>

<p>But this text being published demonstrates the other side of conferences: It motivates me to question and produce. To try to understand where I’m going wrong and look for the best way to solve it.</p>

<p>I went to/stayed more at WWDC and roaming around the city than at Alt. So I missed some very good talks, which I’ll have to watch online when the videos are available.</p>

<p>However, I had the opportunity to talk with some Apple engineers about problems/implementations I’m doing in my day-to-day and calm down knowing that the problems I’m facing are related to bugs in the APIs and not in my code.</p>

<p>I left the US thinking it was a great and productive week, but at the same time, with the feeling that it wasn’t a 100% week.</p>

<p>On the non-technical side: I missed some great opportunities to be with the Brazilian folks and should have prepared to run more around the city. But it was great to go out for drinks/chat with coworkers and to sit, drink, and talk with friends I hadn’t seen in a long time.</p>

<p>I look forward eagerly to next year.</p>
