<p>Yesterday, I had dinner at a table with 4 other French speakers, and it was a fruitful dinner! They spent most of the time speaking French, since there was no reason to change the language on my account, especially since most of them don’t speak English.</p>

<p>But it was a very good dinner; Delicious food: A light soup as a starter, meat prepared with fresh tomato sauce, and pudding for dessert.</p>

<p>It was my plan to order coffee after dinner, since it’s my habit, even though it’s late and I have to wake up early the next day. I’ve never had problems sleeping after an espresso, and in many situations, this has even helped me sleep better.</p>

<p>But I didn’t want to be the stranger at the table. Especially since I was offered a “bonne nuit infusion,” brought in the luggage by one of the pilgrims at the table. It seemed like a good idea to join the French on this occasion.</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be wondering why I’m talking about yesterday’s dinner in today’s diary. To answer your questions: I decided to start with this description because today was a VERY easy walking day.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the last post, the effort to make yesterday’s extended walk to Larrasoaña meant I arrived early in Pamplona, despite, as always, having left late.</p>

<p>This time, I started at what would be halfway for most people. So I met many people along the way. MANY PEOPLE. This made me happy with the idea of leaving hotels late. But having most of the day ahead of me showed me the pleasures of long stops along the journey.</p>

<p>Back to describing today’s route: It was an easy walk done, for most of the day, following a beautiful river, being a graceful pleasure to hear the flow of the river and the singing of birds. However, the end of the route is done entirely through three cities: Trinidad de Arre, Burlada, and Pamplona. These being so close that the border between them is imperceptible.</p>

<figcaption class="imageCaption">Intia building, in Villava</figcaption>

<p>A few hours walking through civilization, on sidewalks and streets, with cars, buses, and daily life happening around you. The architecture and colors of the cities are beautiful, but I need the natural scenery.</p>

<p>By the way, in Trinidad de Arre, I saw a girl carrying a HUGE suitcase, with a selfie stick, and playing music on her phone. When I got closer, I had the impression that I knew the song (something that was confirmed in a few minutes, when I passed the person). Skank! Something that hit the nostalgia. Looking more closely at the backpack, I could see the Brazilian flag, and the flag of the city of Tiradentes.</p>

<p>Right at the entrance to Pamplona, I decided to stay one more day in the city. After all, it’s a big city, with tradition, and many places to see. Two of the city’s biggest events are Carnival and the running of the bulls; I’m not a fan of the first, and I’m against the second, so I believe I won’t have many reasons to return to the city.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think it will be nice to spend one more day here, giving me time to calmly walk around the city and see more things. Besides more time to wash clothes, buy stamps, and finally send some postcards I’ve been carrying with me for a while.</p>
