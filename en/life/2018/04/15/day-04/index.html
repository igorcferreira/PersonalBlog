<p>I stayed in Pamplona today, all day. And I believe it was a good idea.</p>

<hr>

<p>I took advantage of the stop to wash a set of clothes, including my rain cape. It was my first time using a “self-service” laundry service. It’s something interesting. As a bonus, I had time to flip through a magazine about famous Spanish figures (nothing very different from the usual).</p>

<p>Another opportunity I had was to understand Spain’s mail system. I decided to look for stamps to send postcards I have with me, and discovered that there are 3 types of stamps: One for national shipping, one for shipping within the European Union, and one for international shipping, outside the EU. Each with its price and style. In the end, with a little help, I managed to buy the right ones.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’m happy to be able to understand Castilian almost perfectly, even without being able to formulate a sentence currently. I’m using my Spanish as much as I can, in the attempt to, one day, be able to formulate a complete sentence without putting English or Portuguese in the middle. At the moment, I can already not starve! I know how to order coffee, orange juice, a sandwich, and water!</p>

<p>Today, the day honoring the Basque language was celebrated: Euskera. Until now, the entire route has been within the Basque Country, and, just like Catalonia, you can see the Basque flag in the streets and on buildings (alongside the Spanish flag, in some cases).</p>

  <p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> So far, all the “cheese and ham” sandwiches I’ve ordered have been served with artisan cheese and Iberian ham! I have nothing to complain about.</p>
