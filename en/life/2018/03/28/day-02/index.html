<p>Today, I left the town late. This way, I wouldn’t meet many people on the path. And this was true during the first half of the journey. Before lunch, I only met older people, who walked more slowly and stopped many times to rest.</p>

<p>It’s been a peaceful path! Especially when compared to yesterday. It has its climbs, especially after Burguete, but most of the path is a pleasant straight stretch, with a wonderful view.</p>

<hr>

<p>I wrote the previous paragraph during a stop, before arriving in Zubiri, and I should add here that I didn’t have as much pleasure for a good part of the day. There was more descent, but with many rocks, forcing me to slow down and think carefully about where I was stepping. This is something that has always bothered me when walking in London (and in most big cities); Having to slow down because of tourists, groups, or people who take up the entire sidewalk when walking.</p>

<p>Another element that somewhat hindered the end of the day was the decision to follow a “guidebook,” which suggested continuing the walk after Zubiri, based on a decision of a shorter walk the next day, and being able to spend more time in Pamplona. I’m as tired as yesterday, if not more. But we’ll see if it was a good decision or not.</p>

<p>Given these points, it was a peaceful day. I met again the 2 Brazilians and the 2 Irish people I met yesterday. They left the town early, but my slower pace allowed me to “cross paths” with them once again. Apparently, I’ll see them several times throughout the entire journey.</p>

<p>My eyes loved the trail, and my legs are mocking my shoulders. The poor things aren’t used to carrying a loaded backpack for hours. However, I can easily walk for a few more hours (without the backpack) before going to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’m an introvert, and I’m spending most of the day in complete silence, only with my thoughts, and I’m very happy with that. That’s what I came for. I’m just afraid of ending up liking the experience of isolation too much.</p>

<p>Something I could notice, however, was the way I direct myself to people, when it’s something not related to work: Shy, passive at the beginning of conversation, and resilient to “offending” throughout the conversation, becoming more silent. I see that it pushes some people away, and irritates (even if slightly) some others.</p>

  <p><strong>Writer’s note:</strong> Doing the path without drinking beer/alcohol seems fine, but without drinking coffee (which I had planned), I gave up in the very first steps.</p>
