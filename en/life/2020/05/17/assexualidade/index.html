Asexuality

    <span class="post-date">17 May 2020 </span>

    <p>This text will discuss something personal and will mention sexuality. If you’re not interested, I recommend skipping my next posts. That said:</p>

<p>Recently I’ve been posting about ADHD and mental health challenges. And something I’ve only recently resolved is asexuality.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, sexuality is a subject that isn’t debated as it should be (in my opinion). And I grew up in a sexist culture. Not in my home/family, but in my community. Brazil, to this day, is very sexist, and permeates the concept that a man needs to be “Macho.” And part of the fragile masculinity of the “macho” is that a man needs to constantly be desiring sex. Even when it extends to gay men, it’s still culturally expected that “men always think about sex.” And from there comes something that constantly affected my sleep/sanity; Despite identifying as a non-homosexual man, I could never identify as heterosexual. I won’t put myself on the same level of life difficulties as homosexuals or bisexuals, but it was always something that tormented my mind. And it brings me consequences to this day.</p>

<p>For most of my life, to fit into society, I lied to others (and to myself) about relationships. Seeking to say what others wanted to hear, while trying to convince myself that what I said must be the truth I sought. Especially since I’ve always had curiosities about sex. Curiosity of someone who is outside that world and would like to know more about it. Out of simple and pure curiosity. Something that made it difficult for me to understand my choices about relationships and sexuality. I’m very close to my 30s, and only in recent years have I accepted the concept of Asexuality, and accepted that I fit into this spectrum (yes, I believe sexuality is a spectrum, not a defined value. And much less binary). And I must say it was something very comforting.</p>

<p>Comforting because I could accept my curiosity about sex on the same level as my curiosity about cooking or music: What are the factors (social and biological) that lead a human being to prefer X over Y. This point still has an immense impact on my romantic relationships, because it involves expectations and desires. Something very important. But now, at least, it gives me full awareness of what should be debated, how it should be debated, why it should be debated, and with whom to debate.</p>

<p>For those wondering why this long text: Today, more than ever, I believe we (as a society) need to open up to debate sociological and mental health issues. And sexuality is part of that. And a very important part in the formation of a being’s identity. And sexuality, due to religion and conservatism, is something that is aggressively hidden and avoided. However, it plays an important role in human life, since it defines interpersonal relationships. And the understanding of the categorization of relationships.</p>

<p>And with that, I end my account. Kisses, and until next time.</p>
