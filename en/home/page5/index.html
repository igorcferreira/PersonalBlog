          <p class="card-text">Aug 28, 2024</p>
          <p class="card-text"></p>
          <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/causos/2775009">06/02/2011 - A night, a body, and a letter</a></p>
          <p>As always, those corridors were empty and frightened anyone who wasn’t accustomed to them, thanks to the lack of windows and the many burned-out bulbs or those that flickered frantically.</p>
          <p>Rubens loved working at night for being able to be alone with his thoughts and nothing else, but he hated his duties. Having to undress, clean, catalog, and store corpses in the morgue’s refrigerators was repetitive and tedious. The only way to stay there was to keep imagining how each of those bodies came into his hands and guess how many would cry at their coffins.</p>
          <p>In the beginning, he kept a list with names and his guesses to count and see if he got it right (one month he even made a graph), but he no longer had time for that. Now he just imagined the numbers and struck up a light conversation with the cadavers.</p>
          <p>Coming out of his memories a bit, the nurse looked at the clock and realized that his break time was over. Since the installation of electronic locks and the new security system, he could no longer walk through the corridors and seek a bit of life on the upper floors. His life was now monitored.</p>
          <p>He held his coffee mug in one hand, the bag of fruit in the other, the sandwich he was eating, and returned to his workstation. There, he looked for a table without a corpse or any utensils, placed his lunch there, and pulled it closer to the body he decided would be next.</p>
          <p>Between a sip of coffee and a bite of his meal, he put on gloves and grabbed a scalpel to remove the cloths covering the body. There was so much blood and dirt on the man that the fabrics covering him could no longer be called clothing.</p>
          <p>It was one of the few corpses that arrived in this state for him, usually they go through an autopsy first or their clothes, or at least the shirt, are removed in the initial treatments.</p>
          <p>That man who appeared to be in his 40s would have gone unnoticed by Rubens, except for a crumpled and squeezed piece of paper in his left hand.</p>
          <p>The paper was half burned, as was part of the deceased’s hand, identified as Antônio. When unfolded, it showed that the lower part had lost much of its information thanks to the fire and blood that made reading impossible, but most of it could be read:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>I have already made countless mistakes in my life. This is normal, anyone makes them. This is the best gift of the human being, the ability and freedom to make mistakes, we are free to do whatever we want and, if someone gets upset or something goes wrong, just a simple ‘I’m sorry’ and that’s it. You were forgiven. Why? Because you are human.”</p>
            <p>A good philosophy of life. It makes you have a free spirit, carefree and comforted by the incoherence and impunity of life. It creates a demonic illusion that anything can be done, since there is forgiveness for everything.</p>
            <p>Nowadays I’ve passed the party moment and enjoy the magnificent feelings of the ‘day after.’ The hangover that hammers your head with the regret of what shouldn’t have been done, even if it brought good moments.</p>
            <p>I am surrounded by questions that debate and reflect within me: What did I do wrong? At what moment in my life did I make the choice that brought me here? If I could go back and fix a mistake, what would it be? Which of so many?</p>
            <p>Many of the people around me try to calm me down saying that stumbles along the way open a chance for me to rise. Rise for what? To where? Since I stumbled, to the same place I was before? Go back to be able to return to the same place? Never move forward?</p>
            <p>Before the hundreds of bottles of the purest vodka that now adorn my ‘office’ in a very well-formed pile beside me, I would say this is talk of a loser, drunk, or a dead man. But I say the truth in this thought: both. Who writes now is a loser, drunk who no longer exists to society or to anyone.</p>
            <p>I was always surrounded by many friends, but I never had a ‘childhood friend’ or anyone who could stay by my side for more than two years. I always did something wrong, always said ‘I’m sorry’ or ‘forgive me.’</p>
            <p>I never cared about this (after all, why do I need them? I can live well alone), to tell the truth, I never noticed it. I kept isolating myself and recently the only thing left to me were bar buddies or gutter companions through the nights.</p>
            <p>Even my family, father, mother, siblings, people condemned to love you forever, got tired of hearing my apologies, devalued me, and left. This little rhyme I just wrote would put a small smile on my face if it weren’t tragic.</p>
            <p>I discovered, in a not very pleasant way, that there are situations where being human doesn’t help. There are no apologies, there is no forgiveness. The moment when you start to get involved with people who don’t treat you as human.</p>
            <p>I owe a lot of money and it’s time to pay. Actually, this moment already passed many months ago. If I weren’t too drunk for this, I would try to remember the date and the amount I should have paid, but that’s beside the point. In these last moments, I limit myself to thinking about life and putting in this tiny testimony what I deduced through my mistakes.</p>
            <p>For whoever reads this, a small warning: don’t take this as truth, much less as teachings, since a wise man never condemns himself to a death like the one I will have. I will only report as best I can what brought me here and what I took from all this…</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>From this point on, the paper was impossible to read. This was the last and unfinished account of a deceased. That touched Rubens in a way he had never imagined, a body had confessed to him before departing.</p>
          <p>The nurse finished his lunch and his work, organized his things, and went home. Later he discovered in the newspapers that the Antônio from the previous night was a nobody who owed a lot to loan sharks and left this world through the fists of gorillas disguised as people.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contos/2774962">06/02/2011 - Meeting</a></p>
          <p>Nothing that had happened before could predict or explain that scene. The two men exchanged glances as if their eyes were conversing. They knew each other so well that it wasn’t necessary to exchange a single word, they could predict what would be said.</p>
          <p>- Please. I warned you. You knew. - A tall man wearing pinstripe dress pants and a blue t-shirt covered by a white lab coat broke the silence.</p>
          <p>- I simply didn’t believe it. I could never believe this. I forced myself not to believe. - The second man had a bearing and a tone of voice that showed superiority to his listener, but wore only torn and holey jeans and a silver necklace. His chest and arms were dirty, muddy, and covered in blood and wounds.</p>
          <p>A possible hierarchy became clearer, as the man in the lab coat was sitting in a chair in front of a small wooden table while the other was standing on the other side of the jacaranda furniture.</p>
          <p>- Listen Andrew. They asked for this. They asked us to create something that couldn’t be created and I had to convince them of that. - He said while removing his badge and lab coat and placing them on the table.</p>
          <p>The photo on the document showed the face of a strong man, with an unkempt beard and blond, well-combed hair. However, the man who was now rubbing his eyes and leaning on the table while pointing to a chair where his colleague could sit appeared to be tired, had a large, thick, and messy beard, as well as his hair.</p>
          <p>- Oh yes. Brilliant idea. It really worked. And what do you intend to call this new disease that YOU created? Santos’ Disease? It would be a lovely tribute to you, Túlio. - Andrew expressed himself with extreme calm, but at the end kicked the chair that was shown to him, making the furniture cross the small room, crashing into the solid concrete wall.</p>
          <p>- No. I would invent another name. I never liked this surname of mine. Besides, it would confuse people. The epicenter wasn’t the lowlands. Túlio’s sarcasm made Andrew extremely nervous. With superhuman force, he threw the table, which broke into several pieces when it hit an obstacle, and lifted the other man by his neck.</p>
          <p>- So that’s why you’re so nervous. You’re sick. - The weak and hoarse voice due to the obstructed throat was interested and enchanted as was his gaze. - Don’t see this as the end of the world. There are strong points. We can create a vaccine. You can learn to control this. Túlio’s gaze and words met something buried deep in Andrew’s heart. His mind began to swirl with memories. His arms trembled and his head began to burn. For a few moments, he was in other places and silence was maintained in the area. When he came to, his eyes were covered with tears that barely found their path across his injured face.</p>
          <p>- Are you having fun? Do you like being locked up in a tiny room in the basement of a city abandoned to chaos? Or do you just like staying in your social attire playing scientist? - He shouted, throwing the man to the wall on the other side of the room, who hit the wall, gasped in pain, and spat blood while trying to get up. Túlio wiped the tears with the back of his hands, turned, and admired the man who was trying to put strength in his arm muscles as he tried to get up and failed. He kept watching that scene for a few more seconds until he tired of it and turned his attention to the badge that lay near the fallen man.</p>
          <p>- You have no idea what I’ve done. What I’m becoming. - he said picking up the badge. - The great scientist, winner of so many awards, PhD, government worker barely exists anymore.</p>
          <p>- I saw what you will become. I have been working with beings like you. I seek a cure. And you can help me, just stay calm. - He had given up getting up and just turned his body to be able to look at the room. - I think you broke some bone of mine.</p>
          <p>- I told you that this insolent way of yours would irritate me one day. - Andrew finished heading for the exit and stepping on his colleague’s abdomen as he passed him.</p>
          <p>- Wait. - Túlio mumbled when Andrew turned the handle and made the heavy solid metal door turn with a rusty groan. - You can’t go through this door in the state you’re in. You have to stay and wait for me to help you. If you go through this door, the army will come after you.</p>
          <p>- Andrew stopped for a moment, considering what he had just heard and ignored it, returning only to get the white lab coat, partially cover his naked body with it, and head for the exit again. Near the door, Túlio held his colleague’s leg and said:</p>
          <p>- Wherever you go, your dead flesh will not gain color. Your chest will no longer vibrate to the rhythm of your breathing, since it will no longer exist. Your heart will not be capable of feeling, whether hate or love, not even your blood (once hot and fast) will be able to move. Your eyes will no longer be open in their majestic brightness, for they will have no soul to illuminate.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/cartas/2387305">19/07/2010 - Confession</a></p>
          <p>October 31</p>
          <p>Hello,</p>
          <p>It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other, a long time indeed. You may not remember me, no problem, I know I’m not a very memorable person. It might even be a big surprise that this text arrives, which is more likely.</p>
          <p>If this page is declared champion, it will probably be the twentieth letter I’ve tried to write, I can’t be sure because I’ve already lost count, if my mother hasn’t picked up some paper from the floor, it’s the twentieth. I think since the first time I spoke to you, this is my most complicated task, words escape me.</p>
          <p>I’m no longer the same shy person I was before, although I still carry this with me, I’m just not very good with words, I’ve always been a better listener than speaker. At least on paper, things are easier, for sure if someday I bump into you on the street, I’ll only be able to smile and say hi, besides turning red like a tomato.</p>
          <p>Possibly that would be the happiest day of my life since high school. I know it’s kind of depressing, actually very depressing, but I haven’t had many life experiences, my parties were reading Freud accompanied by a good hot chocolate.</p>
          <p>I’m writing all this to be able to confess, despite the long introduction, that’s what this letter is for, to free myself from a ghost. Countless were the times I rehearsed, asked some people for help, and created hopes, without reaching the act, lack of courage, that’s why, in fact, I’m doing this through a letter.</p>
          <p>I find it funny that this martyrdom of mine started with a photo. I was rummaging through my closets trying to make room for suits. Yes, now I have to wear suits, job requirement. In a hidden box were all the photos of the class from the old school, from fifth to eighth grade, exactly the time we studied together.</p>
          <p>That was extremely strong for me, it was like living all that time again, I felt that wonderful pain again, a feeling I missed so much and, at the same time, wished to lose. I still haven’t been able to separate myself from the photos, they’re in front of me, scattered on my desk.</p>
          <p>Too bad I never had the courage to take a photo by your side, this is one of my biggest regrets. I couldn’t resist and went after the people online, but I don’t have your email. I managed to find some social networking pages of yours, including a photoblog.</p>
          <p>Seeing this photoblog was the climax, seeing that your life is good, you’re good, and your eyes still have a superhuman beauty, full of life and shine. I couldn’t push away from my chest this thing that tortures me.</p>
          <p>It’s in the attempt to push away my executioner that I write to you. I want to see if by getting rid of my biggest regret, I can put my head on the pillow and go back to sleep without dreaming of you and how my life could have been if, at that time, I had had the courage to face the truth.</p>
          <p>Please don’t be frightened, I’m not a stalker or someone who spent their life obsessed. As I said, it was the photos that made all this come back to my heart. It had been about four years since I hadn’t suffered this way, since that June festival, the one you won’t remember.</p>
          <p>I chose this day because it was a date you really liked, I hope you still maintain this passion. It was a great inspiration. Stopping to try to remember the reason for the affection with this date, I remembered everything you were to me.</p>
          <p>I’ve already made clear what led me to this, I think. But I’ll never be able to completely say what I feel, this is one of the few things I’m sure of. I’ll try to finish soon, my chest won’t hold out much longer, it’s already very tight, my heart begs for mercy.</p>
          <p>I was in love with you. This sentence is even strange to my eyes, my heart shouts to the seven winds this truth, but my brain can’t agree, I have no way of saying this because I never liked someone again the way I liked you, I think I don’t know what love is.</p>
          <p>Sincerely, A sufferer.</p>
