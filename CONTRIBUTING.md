# Do you wish to contribute to this project?

Hey! ðŸ˜€

I'm glad that you decided to pop by, and contribute to this website! I'm truly am. But, there a few things that I would like you to be aware:

## Project Goal

This is a personal blog. And, given that, all post is "signed" by me, [Igor Ferreira](https://github.com/igorcferreira). So, unfortunately, I'll not be able to accept pull requests that include new posts. But, I'll be trully glad if you have comments/edits regarding my grammar.

## Contribution

If you would like to contribute to this page, firstly: Remember to be kind! This is an open source content, managed by one single person. Also, the world is a better place if everyone tries to be kind!

Secondly, there is 2 main ways to contribute:

### Grammar fixes

If you find any mistake on my grammar, a PR that fixes the issue will be truly appreciated. If you decide to do so, I can add a brief thank you message at the top of the post.

### Code improvements

If you believe that the code can be improved in any way (syntax highlighter css, gem updates, etc), you are also welcome to create a PR.
