[12/02/2011 - Paulista - Trianon](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contoscotidianos/2788451)

The beat silenced for a few moments and returned in another rhythm. This new song was faster, making her quicken her pace, intensifying the run. Ana Luísa had recently moved to the area and loved the idea of having a space to run every morning.

As always, she woke up early, went to the fridge, grabbed the half of a papaya she had started the day before and an apple and a banana from the fruit bowl. Finally, she went to the cupboard and got the last box of milk, noticing she would need to do shopping next Saturday. She noted this on a post-it and stuck it on the cupboard door.

She washed the fruits and sliced them with skin and all, threw them in the blender and added the milk. She still hadn't fully gotten used to the taste of the skins in the smoothie, but she had read in a magazine that it was good for health.

She finished her breakfast with a cup of coffee and a slice of bread with cheese, put on her sportswear, grabbed her MP3, selected a playlist that would motivate her to exercise, and left, locking the door behind her.

In the elevator, she took advantage of the mirror to arrange her long black hair in a ponytail well secured with elastics and clips. She noticed she loved those leggings. They were a nice black, comfortable, and had an incredible power to shape her body.

Already on the street, she stopped at the building entrance and spent long minutes stretching. This process helped avoid injuries and served as a final incentive to go out so early. She was in a central area and, even in the first rays of sun, several people passed by in formal clothes or uniforms, carrying their bags and phones.

Ana loved speculating about the professions of those passing by, as well as a bit of their private lives.
Where were they going?
Why were they going?
Which way would they return at the end of the day?
Where would they return to?
All these questions formed little characters that disappeared from the young woman's mind before clocking in at work.

In the afternoon she would go up a few blocks to the building that had a large number 500 fixed at its entrance on the avenue and would spend her day with drawings, engravings, typography, and other elements of the art department of some fashion magazines. But that was later, now she would go in the opposite direction, toward the park.

She could cut through the parallel streets and go up to the avenue only near her destination. This, in fact, was the easier path, there were fewer people, but she would lose the great movement of people and cars that she loved to see accompanied by the sound of her music. Decided, she checked if her sneakers were well tied and began her walk.

This was her warm-up.
Take a small hill up to the avenue, cross a few blocks, pass in front of the Gazeta building, FIESP, cross the street in front of MASP and finally enter the park, count a few steps and start her jog.
First wandering, but gradually increasing.

She finished her run accompanied by trees and people who pass by there to cut through. At the exit, she stopped at the newsstand in front, there she found the two policemen she always ran into, asked for water, bought some magazines, the newspaper, and took her way back.

She would still stop at the gym on the way home. She would do some exercises for arms, abdomen, and some aerobics, would go home, take a good and long shower, change, and happily and motivated go to work.

Going over the day made her take a deep breath and smile.
An involuntary movement.
When she paid attention to what was happening in front of her, she saw a young man dressed in poorly adjusted formal clothes, walking calmly, as if he had no destination, calmly and slowly.

The young man carried a backpack on his back which he took off and sat near one of the fountains that adorned the base of the museum. Before continuing on her way, Ana still watched long enough to see him pull from the bag a large green book, glasses, headphones, a music player, and prepare to spend some time reading.
