[22/05/2011 - Melody of an angel](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contossurreais/2986670)

The theater stood in the middle of the city. The tall buildings, majestic and refined, surrounded that construction from the last millennium. Wood, scaffolding, and metal pieces covered its doors and windows, and its walls had their paint peeling and hiding the life that once reigned there.

For many years, people passed in front of the building and ignored it completely. Some generations held marches, protested, spoke, and were heard, but no renovation was ever completed. The few that started to be done were cursed with accidents and deaths.

Against the wishes of the big businessmen, the city kept the building's facade and maintains it standing as a reminder of the years of glory of what was the greatest stage of all time, until forces closed its doors forever.

Many elders are still able to recount how the glorious flames danced in its windows while consuming everything and everyone inside. According to the newspapers, nothing managed to cross the portals and reach life since the statues that adorned the passages were the first to fall, placing tons of art in the paths of salvation.

Those who pass through the lively square in the dead of night are able to say they heard the singing of thousands of people claiming life through a harmonious and beautiful choir, accompanied by the beautiful steps of the old curtains that come out to the audience, having the wind as their dance partner.

On one of these nights, when the full moon reigned at night, accompanied by its stars, a young woman who had missed the chance to catch the last transport home decided to wait the hours pass reading at the door of the old mausoleum.

As so many others had reported, it took only twelve tolls of the bell for the notes to begin to sound and the leaves of the trees to follow their rhythm. At first, the innocent winds passing through there were blamed for the melody, but it soon became clear that they contributed nothing to the phenomenon.

The girl, enchanted by the sound reaching her ears, closed her books along with her eyes and traveled in the suffering that allegro brought to her heart, while at the same time filling her soul with calm and radiance.

At the entrance of the second movement, a cello joined, removing the voices from the a cappella art, inserting them into a magical and morbid duet. The listener's mind added violins, horns, trumpets, and oboes to the music, completing a glorious and false symphony.

While reason forced the opposite movement, the young woman's body followed into the interior of the great stone monument, even without knowing the way. Her curiosity could not be contained before the fear of the unknown.

Inside, the scene was supernatural. Candles hung on glorious copper chandeliers were lit on the wall, and the ceiling shone with the help of a majestic crystal chandelier hanging by strong chains of the strongest iron. The antechamber, empty and enchanted with the most beautiful carpets, enchanted with a brightness invisible to its exterior.

Continuing, the vision was even more majestic. In the main room, the boxes leapt glamorous, living above the seats of the most beautiful red wool that contrasted with the oak that completed the seats. In them, several people sang with tuned voices, accompanied by the maestro playing at center stage.

The young woman knew it was impossible for a wooden object to sound with such force to fill the place with such vivacity, but the reality of the moment made everything seem real and plausible. Even more so when she glimpsed who moved the strings with such skill.

A tall and strong man covered part of the instrument with his long, straight, and black hair. His face was white, well-defined, and young. He was dressed in a smooth, beautiful, and well-tailored tuxedo that showed no resistance to the movements of his arms.

His gaze invited one to approach, something that was respected. The closer she got, everything around was disappearing and existence was limited to that being and the sounds that were born in his hands.

All the magic of the event was completed when the concert ended. Saying goodbye to an audience that stood up to recite the heroic finale, the musician rose from his seat while opening glorious and beautiful white wings that filled the stage with peace, calm, and happiness.

The applause of the ghosts that filled the audience made the conductor say goodbye to his listener with a look of gratitude and disappear covering his body through the feathered structure that leapt from his back.

The noise of the large book hitting the floor made the girl wake from the most beautiful dream and find herself trapped inside an old building, consumed by flames and abandoned by time.

The disappeared seats were marked by rotting and charred bodies. The walls were black from smoke and were falling from lack of strength. The stage only existed thanks to its strong metal roots, and the main chandelier lay within it.

Scared and confused, she ran, wishing for life, wishing for presence, wishing to feel she could still walk as mortal. Upon crossing a small gap that freed her from that cemetery, she saw the sun welcoming her to the world she knew. She could finally catch the bus home and survive among her loved ones.

The theater was still dead among the modernity that had risen around it, but the young woman never passed by there again without wishing and without fearing, longing to hear that beautiful sound played by the most beautiful creature and accompanied by the most wretched souls.
