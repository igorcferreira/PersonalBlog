In the morning, an accident

The day dawned like any other.
Black clouds hid the sun behind a cold breeze and a light drizzle that invited workers to
hide in their homes or coats.
Several cars lined up in a procession through the asphalt and umbrellas floated along accompanied
by solitude and individuality.

In one of the cars, the sound system emitted a light and melodic baroque music that reached the ears of a young man,
accompanied by the honking of motorcycles.
A cigarette was being consumed, held very carelessly out the open window, and the driver accelerated and
braked following traffic automatically,
as if the body knew what to do without the need for the mind to intervene in such actions.

The typical commute to work was already stretching longer than normal, but this wasn't even close to causing
any worry for Carlos, who was traveling in his thoughts that went far beyond that congested road
or the immense buildings that bordered it.

It was even a surprise and somewhat annoying when the car started moving faster after passing a construction site in the middle of the lane.
Now attention was focused on what was happening ahead, but his mind still came and went occasionally.

His distraction was accentuated by the change of music on the radio. Now the rhythm of the symphony made the steering wheel the
target of rhythmic blows and a humming accompanied by whistles emerged and took over the entire vehicle.
He even looked at the street clock, but didn't notice he was absurdly late.

At the moment the orchestra was preparing for the presentation of the second theme, the young man's attention returned due to a dull thud
and a strong jolt. Just to clear his soul of guilt, Carlos raised his eyes and saw the red light guiding drivers,
it wasn't him who was wrong, a good sign.

Upon getting out of the car, he forgot for a few seconds why he was there and flew to a past that never existed and
to a future still being built, all because of a face, an image that came before him
and touched his heart like no other image could.

No one will ever be able to explain why or how this happened,
the sequence of events contributed to a completely different path, but Carlos didn't worry,
he just enjoyed a wonderful day in the company of one of the most beautiful figures he had ever seen.

Both talked and laughed about the accident, the traffic, and the complication they caused, the delay and confusion with the tow trucks, and
even the fact of being forced to return home on foot that afternoon,
neither of them even remembering that they hadn't gone to work, just enjoying the pause in a dry and sheltered bar.

The rain, the noise of people, the waiter offering another beer, nothing made the young man take his eyes off the beautiful
figure on the other side of the table. She was a redhead, brown eyes, young, cheerful, somewhat absent-minded, and youthful.
Her unpreparedness to deal with certain situations (traffic accidents especially) only took her one more step
toward perfection for the simple human who admired her and happily opened a silly smile every time his companion
gifted him with a look.

This moment stretched for a long time, but it happened before the clock caught its breath to move its hands and
only ended with the most irritating cell phone ring in the world at that moment.
Júlia was receiving a call from her boss asking if everything was okay and inquiring about her absence.
Life always tries to show you that your existence is insignificant,
but remember that your soul is immeasurable and even the universe can be small next to a being completed by the presence
of those one loves.

Both, after much negotiation, managed to get excused from work (a traffic accident shakes anyone's emotions),
they went to the movies to watch an action and comedy film,
left very happy to have chosen the new animation that had just premiered and went to lunch.
Even with much reluctance and constant discussion,
Carlos always paid the bills and promised that he would let the girl pay the next one.

The afternoon was blessed with a shy sun among the clouds and a discussion about literary works in front of
a bookstore window in the mall. With some disagreements, each completely agreed with the other's criticisms
and the conversation kept getting more and more pleasant.

A majestic full moon appeared to warn passersby that this day, despite reluctance, should end.
But a cycle had to close, interrupting a moment of wonderful peace and satisfaction and storing it in the safest vault,
memory. With a promise to see each other again, each took a taxi and went their way, with immeasurable happiness in their hearts,
accompanied by the hope of hearing the phone ring,
without realizing they hadn't exchanged phone numbers or any other form of communication.
