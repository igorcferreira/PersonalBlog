[08/12/2013 - The string family](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/pensamentos/2844740)

The string family is very interesting.
The classical double bass is the great elder, and the cello is that older uncle who lives in Europe
with his son violin and his daughter viola.
The acoustic guitar is the country uncle who works the fields with his annoying son, the ukulele.
And the electric guitar and bass are the metropolitan "hipsters."

Igor Castañeda Ferreira
