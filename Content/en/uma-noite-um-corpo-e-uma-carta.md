[06/02/2011 - A night, a body, and a letter](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/causos/2775009)

As always, those corridors were empty and frightened anyone who wasn't accustomed to them, thanks to the lack of windows and the many burned-out bulbs or those that flickered frantically.

Rubens loved working at night for being able to be alone with his thoughts and nothing else, but he hated his duties. Having to undress, clean, catalog, and store corpses in the morgue's refrigerators was repetitive and tedious. The only way to stay there was to keep imagining how each of those bodies came into his hands and guess how many would cry at their coffins.

In the beginning, he kept a list with names and his guesses to count and see if he got it right (one month he even made a graph), but he no longer had time for that. Now he just imagined the numbers and struck up a light conversation with the cadavers.

Coming out of his memories a bit, the nurse looked at the clock and realized that his break time was over. Since the installation of electronic locks and the new security system, he could no longer walk through the corridors and seek a bit of life on the upper floors. His life was now monitored.

He held his coffee mug in one hand, the bag of fruit in the other, the sandwich he was eating, and returned to his workstation. There, he looked for a table without a corpse or any utensils, placed his lunch there, and pulled it closer to the body he decided would be next.

Between a sip of coffee and a bite of his meal, he put on gloves and grabbed a scalpel to remove the cloths covering the body. There was so much blood and dirt on the man that the fabrics covering him could no longer be called clothing.

It was one of the few corpses that arrived in this state for him, usually they go through an autopsy first or their clothes, or at least the shirt, are removed in the initial treatments.

That man who appeared to be in his 40s would have gone unnoticed by Rubens, except for a crumpled and squeezed piece of paper in his left hand.

The paper was half burned, as was part of the deceased's hand, identified as Antônio. When unfolded, it showed that the lower part had lost much of its information thanks to the fire and blood that made reading impossible, but most of it could be read:

> I have already made countless mistakes in my life. This is normal, anyone makes them. This is the best gift of the human being, the ability and freedom to make mistakes, we are free to do whatever we want and, if someone gets upset or something goes wrong, just a simple 'I'm sorry' and that's it. You were forgiven. Why? Because you are human."
>
> A good philosophy of life. It makes you have a free spirit, carefree and comforted by the incoherence and impunity of life. It creates a demonic illusion that anything can be done, since there is forgiveness for everything.
>
> Nowadays I've passed the party moment and enjoy the magnificent feelings of the 'day after.' The hangover that hammers your head with the regret of what shouldn't have been done, even if it brought good moments.
>
> I am surrounded by questions that debate and reflect within me: What did I do wrong? At what moment in my life did I make the choice that brought me here? If I could go back and fix a mistake, what would it be? Which of so many?
>
> Many of the people around me try to calm me down saying that stumbles along the way open a chance for me to rise. Rise for what? To where? Since I stumbled, to the same place I was before? Go back to be able to return to the same place? Never move forward?
>
> Before the hundreds of bottles of the purest vodka that now adorn my 'office' in a very well-formed pile beside me, I would say this is talk of a loser, drunk, or a dead man. But I say the truth in this thought: both. Who writes now is a loser, drunk who no longer exists to society or to anyone.
>
> I was always surrounded by many friends, but I never had a 'childhood friend' or anyone who could stay by my side for more than two years. I always did something wrong, always said 'I'm sorry' or 'forgive me.'
>
> I never cared about this (after all, why do I need them? I can live well alone), to tell the truth, I never noticed it. I kept isolating myself and recently the only thing left to me were bar buddies or gutter companions through the nights.
>
> Even my family, father, mother, siblings, people condemned to love you forever, got tired of hearing my apologies, devalued me, and left. This little rhyme I just wrote would put a small smile on my face if it weren't tragic.
>
> I discovered, in a not very pleasant way, that there are situations where being human doesn't help. There are no apologies, there is no forgiveness. The moment when you start to get involved with people who don't treat you as human.
>
> I owe a lot of money and it's time to pay. Actually, this moment already passed many months ago. If I weren't too drunk for this, I would try to remember the date and the amount I should have paid, but that's beside the point. In these last moments, I limit myself to thinking about life and putting in this tiny testimony what I deduced through my mistakes.
>
> For whoever reads this, a small warning: don't take this as truth, much less as teachings, since a wise man never condemns himself to a death like the one I will have. I will only report as best I can what brought me here and what I took from all this...

From this point on, the paper was impossible to read. This was the last and unfinished account of a deceased. That touched Rubens in a way he had never imagined, a body had confessed to him before departing.

The nurse finished his lunch and his work, organized his things, and went home. Later he discovered in the newspapers that the Antônio from the previous night was a nobody who owed a lot to loan sharks and left this world through the fists of gorillas disguised as people.
