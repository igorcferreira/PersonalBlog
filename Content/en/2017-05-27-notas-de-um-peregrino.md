![Boots and notebook in front of Santiago church]({{ site.url }}/public/boots.jpg){: .center-image }

I decided to post here, first in Portuguese, the log of a small trip I took through northern Spain: The first third of the [Camino de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago).

These texts that will come over an uncertain period are extracts from a diary that was written during the trip, with small edits and translations (since it had passages in Portuguese, English, and Spanish). I decided to write this account to resume the practice of writing, and to preserve in words some things that may disappear or fade in memory.

Additionally, some other decisions were made: No specific dates, no names of people, no detailed physical descriptions, no going into the minutiae of the route, and no heavy filtering of the thoughts that permeated me during the journey.

At this moment, I've already finished the path, and I'm at home, with a beer, or a coffee, or churros, writing what this red notebook holds. Some have already seen some photos, or have already heard a bit about the events. But for those who have heard nothing, enjoy!
