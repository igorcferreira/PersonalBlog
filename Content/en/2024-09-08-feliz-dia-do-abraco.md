[22/05/2011 - Happy hug day](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/frases/2986393)

In a hug, two hearts come together to vibrate in the same rhythm.
It's a moment where two souls truly share the same body, the same feeling, the same experience.
Undeniable connection between any human being, sometimes feared, but always adored by those who suffer and by those who love.

Igor Castañeda Ferreira
