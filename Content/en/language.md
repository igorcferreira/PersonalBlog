Another quick thought: In which language should I post my content?

This is a question that hits me every time I open a new post file, or even Twitter. In which language should I write my opinion?

I believe the Brazilian community needs more content in Portuguese! Especially in the technology area. But my reality isn't just Brazil.

On Twitter, I have followers who speak the most diverse languages and most speak or understand English. My coworkers, including, speak English.

So I'm left with this doubt: In which language should I post? Not just technical opinions, but things from my daily life. I don't want to distance myself from my homeland and friends, but I feel I lose interaction with people by posting only in Portuguese.
