[18/07/2010 - Photos](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/pensamentos/2385723)

I've heard and seen in some productions that Eastern culture, with the introduction of the camera, repudiated the photo for fear that the device was capable of absorbing and imprisoning the soul.

We all know this isn't true, but I find it incredible how photography has power in many situations. Sometimes when someone picks up a photo from another person's trip, they find it grotesque how the individual agrees to pose with a blank expression, but whoever is in that photo and whoever took it is swept with memories and feelings.

An image may not be able to keep your soul, but it carries within it various feelings and "ghosts," using them against people with surgical precision. It puts its hand on your heart and caresses it or squeezes it as if the two were the same thing.

This is a power that only still images have, since they require your creativity and memories for the steps to be retraced, besides giving you a clear and vivid description of what it's about.

It's possible to revisit shapes, colors, and mainly, looks. Like those of your best childhood friend, your first school crush, your first disagreement with that person you haven't seen for years.

These tools can capture from infrared to the clearest rainbow, but beyond that, they can capture moments.
