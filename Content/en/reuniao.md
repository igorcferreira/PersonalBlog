[06/02/2011 - Meeting](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/contos/2774962)

Nothing that had happened before could predict or explain that scene. The two men exchanged glances as if their eyes were conversing. They knew each other so well that it wasn't necessary to exchange a single word, they could predict what would be said.

\- Please. I warned you. You knew. - A tall man wearing pinstripe dress pants and a blue t-shirt covered by a white lab coat broke the silence.

\- I simply didn't believe it. I could never believe this. I forced myself not to believe. - The second man had a bearing and a tone of voice that showed superiority to his listener, but wore only torn and holey jeans and a silver necklace. His chest and arms were dirty, muddy, and covered in blood and wounds.

A possible hierarchy became clearer, as the man in the lab coat was sitting in a chair in front of a small wooden table while the other was standing on the other side of the jacaranda furniture.

\- Listen Andrew. They asked for this. They asked us to create something that couldn't be created and I had to convince them of that. - He said while removing his badge and lab coat and placing them on the table.

The photo on the document showed the face of a strong man, with an unkempt beard and blond, well-combed hair. However, the man who was now rubbing his eyes and leaning on the table while pointing to a chair where his colleague could sit appeared to be tired, had a large, thick, and messy beard, as well as his hair.

\- Oh yes. Brilliant idea. It really worked. And what do you intend to call this new disease that YOU created? Santos' Disease? It would be a lovely tribute to you, Túlio. - Andrew expressed himself with extreme calm, but at the end kicked the chair that was shown to him, making the furniture cross the small room, crashing into the solid concrete wall.

\- No. I would invent another name. I never liked this surname of mine. Besides, it would confuse people. The epicenter wasn't the lowlands.
Túlio's sarcasm made Andrew extremely nervous. With superhuman force, he threw the table, which broke into several pieces when it hit an obstacle, and lifted the other man by his neck.

\- So that's why you're so nervous. You're sick. - The weak and hoarse voice due to the obstructed throat was interested and enchanted as was his gaze. - Don't see this as the end of the world. There are strong points. We can create a vaccine. You can learn to control this.
Túlio's gaze and words met something buried deep in Andrew's heart. His mind began to swirl with memories. His arms trembled and his head began to burn. For a few moments, he was in other places and silence was maintained in the area. When he came to, his eyes were covered with tears that barely found their path across his injured face.

\- Are you having fun? Do you like being locked up in a tiny room in the basement of a city abandoned to chaos? Or do you just like staying in your social attire playing scientist? - He shouted, throwing the man to the wall on the other side of the room, who hit the wall, gasped in pain, and spat blood while trying to get up.
Túlio wiped the tears with the back of his hands, turned, and admired the man who was trying to put strength in his arm muscles as he tried to get up and failed. He kept watching that scene for a few more seconds until he tired of it and turned his attention to the badge that lay near the fallen man.

\- You have no idea what I've done. What I'm becoming. - he said picking up the badge. - The great scientist, winner of so many awards, PhD, government worker barely exists anymore.

\- I saw what you will become. I have been working with beings like you. I seek a cure. And you can help me, just stay calm. - He had given up getting up and just turned his body to be able to look at the room. - I think you broke some bone of mine.

\- I told you that this insolent way of yours would irritate me one day. - Andrew finished heading for the exit and stepping on his colleague's abdomen as he passed him.

\- Wait. - Túlio mumbled when Andrew turned the handle and made the heavy solid metal door turn with a rusty groan. - You can't go through this door in the state you're in. You have to stay and wait for me to help you. If you go through this door, the army will come after you.

\- Andrew stopped for a moment, considering what he had just heard and ignored it, returning only to get the white lab coat, partially cover his naked body with it, and head for the exit again. Near the door, Túlio held his colleague's leg and said:

\- Wherever you go, your dead flesh will not gain color. Your chest will no longer vibrate to the rhythm of your breathing, since it will no longer exist. Your heart will not be capable of feeling, whether hate or love, not even your blood (once hot and fast) will be able to move. Your eyes will no longer be open in their majestic brightness, for they will have no soul to illuminate.
