title: I'd like to say I don't know how to use the internet!

I recently moved to Barcelona and, due to Spanish bureaucracy, I can't sign long-term contracts (apart from my rental contract). Because of this, one fact permeates my life: I don't have internet at home, and I have a mobile plan with limited data.

This causes a life change: I can't use the internet outside of work, beyond text messages. And, honestly, it was something very good. Because it proved one thing to me: I don't know how to use the internet.

The internet is a sensational tool that enables the interconnection of processing and storage units around the world. With this, access to information is facilitated, as is processing and analysis of that information!

But in our daily reality, that's not what the internet is used for... Rather, it's for entertainment: Series, random videos, cat gifs, etc.

As someone who uses the internet to keep in touch with family and friends who live in other countries, I put myself in a pretty bad situation. YouTube video after YouTube video. Millions of series on the playlist. A long list of comics to read.

But little literary reading of greater complexity (I love comics, but the reduced volume doesn't allow for great philosophical work, like books do); Little technical reading; And, mainly, closing myself off to the online world.

Barcelona is a city that invites you to leave your apartment. Beautiful weather, impressive architecture, inviting beach, and WONDERFUL food. Yet, I would spend some afternoons reviewing PRs that spilled over from the workday, series after series, YouTube videos after YouTube videos...

Entertaining yourself with these art forms isn't a problem. But I believe it's valid to load your e-reader with publications and sit by the boardwalk to read; Walk to the cinema to watch a session of a local film; Have a beer while listening to live music.

Know how to use the internet as a tool for accessing information, not as a socialization tool! :)
