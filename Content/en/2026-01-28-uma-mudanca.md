title: A change
---

11 years ago I was moving from São Paulo to London.
And 9 years ago I wrote the post [So long... Thanks for all the fish!](/en/life/2017/03/28/so-long/),
where I talked about my move from London to Barcelona.

Now, a new change is happening in my life. At the end of March, I say goodbye to [Future Workshops](https://futureworkshops.com),
a company where I've worked for the last 10 years. A decade that ends.

I say goodbye because the company has reached a point where I no longer identify with it. The projects, the clients, the challenges,
and the day-to-day are no longer the same. The strategy of investing in the Saudi Arabia market, and the consequences
of that investment, no longer make me comfortable being at the company.

At the beginning of this investment, I wrote the post [Asexuality](/en/life/2020/05/17/assexualidade), and the desire to write
that post came, in part, from the change in reality that is being involved in Saudi Arabian culture. For years I tried
to understand the consequences and what was happening, and in the last 2 years I tried to motivate the company to end/change
the relationship with the region. Now, it's my moment to distance myself.

I still really like the people who work at the company, in London and Barcelona, and ending this relationship was
not an easy decision, since I would like to still work with this team. But, in fact,
it's my moment to distance myself.

You, who read this here, and are not related to the company nor know the company, must be wondering: "And what does this have to do with me?"

My answer to you is: I don't know.

I just wanted to write and publish my thought. Especially since, now, comes the biggest question: And what do I do now?

My job was a big factor for my staying in Barcelona. Living in Europe has great benefits.
But I feel alone. I didn't make friendships outside of work, and my family is an ocean away.
It's time to decide if staying in Europe is still an option. And even if I stay in Europe,
whether staying in Barcelona is a good option.

I believe I'll write again when I've decided, but I wanted to write that I need to think.
