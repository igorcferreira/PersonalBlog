Today, I left the town late. This way, I wouldn't meet many people on the path. And this was true during the first half of the journey. Before lunch, I only met older people, who walked more slowly and stopped many times to rest.

It's been a peaceful path! Especially when compared to yesterday. It has its climbs, especially after Burguete, but most of the path is a pleasant straight stretch, with a wonderful view.

I wrote the previous paragraph during a stop, before arriving in Zubiri, and I should add here that I didn't have as much pleasure for a good part of the day. There was more descent, but with many rocks, forcing me to slow down and think carefully about where I was stepping. This is something that has always bothered me when walking in London (and in most big cities); Having to slow down because of tourists, groups, or people who take up the entire sidewalk when walking.

Another element that somewhat hindered the end of the day was the decision to follow a "guidebook," which suggested continuing the walk after Zubiri, based on a decision of a shorter walk the next day, and being able to spend more time in Pamplona. I'm as tired as yesterday, if not more. But we'll see if it was a good decision or not.

Given these points, it was a peaceful day. I met again the 2 Brazilians and the 2 Irish people I met yesterday. They left the town early, but my slower pace allowed me to "cross paths" with them once again. Apparently, I'll see them several times throughout the entire journey.

My eyes loved the trail, and my legs are mocking my shoulders. The poor things aren't used to carrying a loaded backpack for hours. However, I can easily walk for a few more hours (without the backpack) before going to sleep.

I'm an introvert, and I'm spending most of the day in complete silence, only with my thoughts, and I'm very happy with that. That's what I came for. I'm just afraid of ending up liking the experience of isolation too much.

Something I could notice, however, was the way I direct myself to people, when it's something not related to work: Shy, passive at the beginning of conversation, and resilient to "offending" throughout the conversation, becoming more silent. I see that it pushes some people away, and irritates (even if slightly) some others.

> **Writer's note:** Doing the path without drinking beer/alcohol seems fine, but without drinking coffee (which I had planned), I gave up in the very first steps.
