"I would like to be able to apologize, say thank you, and proclaim to the seven winds what my heart has carried for so long.
Could I gather enough courage to put my soul at risk and look into your beautiful eyes while
I free myself from this weight that consumes me? I'm sorry for saying what I said and doing what I did,
but turning myself into a monster to your senses was the best way to push you away from my eyes,
since I will never be able to push you away from my thoughts."

Igor Castañeda Ferreira
