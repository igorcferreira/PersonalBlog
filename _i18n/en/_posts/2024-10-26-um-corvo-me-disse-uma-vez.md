[15/09/2011 - A crow once told me:](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/mensagens/3220245)

Study, laws, question, learn to go after the solution to your problems. Try to find the peace of your spirit in the fullness of resolution. But don't lose yourself in yourself. Have fun, have and make memorable moments. Throw yourself into lost hours with "nothing."

Have friends. Even if few. But true ones. You'll realize that you're nothing, nor anyone, without them. Know that the most important thing in life is knowing that those who love you are and will always be by your side. A motivation for all suffering.

Family is the ultimate happiness. Not just the so-called "relatives," but all who make you smile with a simple memory or just hearing their names. You are not alone in the world. And it's these faces that will embrace your heart in a tender feeling called longing.

Be humble, strong, hardworking, and dedicated. Altruism is what sustains a real society. Seek your tranquility, even if it's immersed in chaos. Know that you will find happiness in love. And, for that love, give yourself, even if it hurts. You won't regret having "lived eternity" in someone else's arms.

Upon fulfilling such objectives, be strong. They will take advantage of you. They will make you suffer. Your trust will be broken and your heart crumpled like paper. Bad times will come! And, for sure, they will pass.

Finally, one thing I assure you: "There is no formula for happiness." Thank God. This is because it's in every moment, every second. In the eyes of the one you love, in the hug of reunion, in the tears of goodbye... It's up to you to see it.
