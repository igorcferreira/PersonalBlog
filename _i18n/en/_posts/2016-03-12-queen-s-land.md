The first winter I've spent in the Queen's land has come to an end, and I believe I've had time to get somewhat acquainted with the city! <i>(For those of you who imagined I would talk about the region in northeastern Australia or the Indian park, I apologize)</i>

The life change to London wasn't easy. Even more so coming here alone, without family and friends. Something that was alleviated by the great colleagues I have at work and by my cousin who already lived here.

I didn't have time to be a tourist, I started working (a lot) on my second day here, I'm already exchanging letters with the government to balance a year of taxes, and I'm a great example of introverts, so I can't give a complete view of the city, but I can give you my view of this beautiful place:

# A city for everyone

The first thing that impresses in London (as in many cities in Europe) is the mix of old and new. In architecture, art, and even culture.

But something that's very clear is that London is a city for everyone. Here, anyone can find their "tribe," regardless of which cultural movement they belong to.

Clubs, music, street art, parks, museums, libraries, universities, etc. You can do whatever you want and learn new things.

# The world is here

This multicultural city clearly came together thanks to the language, the country's history, the economy, and participation in the European Union. Because here, you hear every language in the world.

London is a city powered by immigrants. This is constantly a topic of political debates and, sometimes, xenophobia, but it's a truth. The biggest proof is the restaurants. One thing I love is how easy it is to find any type of food!

# Pub culture

I love gastronomy and beer, and this is a very good city for both. Especially for the famous happy hour!

The country has a pub culture. A Londoner drinks a lot of beer! This is a fact. Thus, you find a pub on every corner, with ale on tap and lager aplenty. It's easy to see pubs busy at breakfast, lunch, and late afternoon. With groups of friends drinking wine, beer, cider, tomato juice, or some other drink.

# Coffee shops

![Coffee shops](http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Phone-box-coffee-595709.jpg){: .center-image }

It's not just beer that moves London, we also have coffee and, of course, tea! The amount of tea a British person drinks is ridiculous. The kettle is always boiling water, all day long, especially in offices.

That's why, just like pubs, it's very easy to find a coffee shop. Big brands like Costa and Nero share space with smaller, more artisanal places. And no, there aren't as many Starbucks as in NY, or even São Paulo. The brand is even hated by some.

# Weather

![Weather](https://kniftonholdingcourt.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/wpid-img_5055690190826.jpeg?w=620){: .center-image }

One thing that's a recurring topic here (and taken very seriously) is the weather! Something that can be summed up as: awful!

Many take vitamin D and use S.A.D. lamps to survive the constant rain, gray skies, and winter with darkness falling at 4 in the afternoon.

# House

Now, there are things you only notice when you've been here for a while, or if you plan to stay here for a while. The first and most significant is the price of housing in London. Which is absurdly expensive. Really!

Also, there are some characteristics of British residences that are quite different from Brazilian ones. Things like:

> Power outlet

> Heating

> Clothesline inside the house

# Self checkout

![Self checkout](https://regmedia.co.uk/2013/10/04/checkout.jpg?x=1200&y=794){: .center-image }

Another thing that's quite different is shopping. Unlike São Paulo, shopping is usually done at pound stores and neighborhood markets. Not at giant supermarkets. Places like Sainsbury's and Tesco.

Now, one phenomenal thing is self checkout. All smaller supermarkets have terminals where you can scan items and pay without needing an attendant.

> Self checkout + Contactless = <abbr title="love">❤️</abbr>

# Contactless

![Contactless](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Universal_Contactless_Card_Symbol.svg/1280px-Universal_Contactless_Card_Symbol.svg.png){: .center-image }

Along with self checkout, something that helps a lot is contactless payment. This is a system that uses NFC on your debit card and allows you to make payments without having to enter your PIN.

This way, you can quickly pay for small purchases, metro (underground), and buses. You can even use devices with contactless payment (iPhone, Apple Watch, etc). Never again go through the situation of not having credit on your travel card.

# Public system

![Underground](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/London_Underground_Interior_Jubilee_line.jpg){: .center-image }

One thing that works beautifully is the British public system. At least, the services I've needed!

Complete and punctual public transport (just not cheap); The health system is punctual and efficient (but a bit confusing); Efficient and friendly police and surveillance system.

# Cost of living

![](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02854/ed_2854911b.jpg){: .center-image }

The city isn't perfect for several reasons. But one of the strongest is the cost of living!

As I mentioned before, the cost to rent/buy a residence is absurd. Many people share apartments, renting a room. And in the center, rent can reach £1000 per week (No, I didn't make a mistake, it's per week).

Earning in pounds helps a lot, especially when traveling around Europe. Since the currency is well-valued worldwide. But when you arrive in the city and spend a month paying bills in reais, it really hurts the wallet.

# Bedtime

Another thing that bothers a paulista a lot is how early the city closes. I still haven't managed to adjust my life schedule to the city.

I always started work late and worked until late because, in São Paulo, I could, after 9 PM, stop by the mall to buy some things, stop at a restaurant and supermarket before going home.

You know that paulista thing of pre-drinking until midnight and then going to a club? Here, by 8 PM things are already closing. The official closing time for pubs is 11 PM!!!

I went to a Nightwish concert here and couldn't find anything open to have dinner afterwards... Traumatic.

> I'd like to mention that I know there are many clubs that stay open until 4 AM

# Lunch

Something I thought was part of the culture of the company I work for, but later discovered isn't, is how lunchtime works.

Normally, people buy what they're going to eat (sandwiches or complete meals) and eat in front of the computer, at their desks.

For someone who used to spend 2 hours at lunch at a table, with friends, having a beer, it's something, at the very least, strange.

# Winter blue

I'd like to emphasize that [the weather is really bad](http://www.dailyedge.ie/penguins-antidepressants-weather-1306136-Feb2014/) in London. So bad that people who come from tropical countries are recommended to get vitamin D injections from time to time.

Something that affects many people (myself included) is the so-called [winter blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder).

The lack of sun affects people's psychology, who start to have much more drowsiness and symptoms similar to depression. It can even lead to depression.

It's something I went through and, honestly, it's pretty bad! In fact, this post should have come out on February 2nd. But I was so unwell last month that I couldn't write a single line.

# Conclusion

I think this covers some points I wanted to cover about my time in London *so far*. If you have any questions, just send a tweet to [@igorcferreira@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@igorcferreira) and I can answer questions.
