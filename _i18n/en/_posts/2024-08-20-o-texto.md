[15/07/2010 - The Text](https://www.recantodasletras.com.br/pensamentos/2380117)

I've read a lot about the ability and art of writing, but I learned little from it. There are many texts that talk about how to divide paragraphs, how to delimit the theme, how to divide the acts, and when to interrupt an event, but they weren't capable of making me write.

It was when, flipping through a book about audiovisual, I read a small phrase loose in the middle of the page: "For the story to be a story, it's necessary that the characters have life, it's necessary that the facts occur by themselves, without the interference of the author."

This small excerpt marked my thoughts, I slept many days with that in my head and to this day I can't remember what book it was and who the author was, unfortunately.

I know I'm not good at this, but it's great therapy. The attempt to create lives and events, making them get out of your control to the point of hating the antagonist and rooting for the protagonist while your fingers touch the keys, is magical.
